I go to station to take my mind off my worries.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000216)
After having lunch at <DICT>King Burger</DICT>, I end up drinking coffee at the %B2SStarbecks%B2E on the first floor of Yodobashi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000232)
I left behind Mayuri and the others.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000242)
I wanted to think alone for a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000252)
When I sent the D-mail to myself in the past with the LOTO SIX numbers, I felt a strong tremor, and then the world as I knew it faintly "changed".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000262)
The fact that I had sent a D-mail had been undone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000272)
I can confirm that with the fact that it had disappeared from my send history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000282)
But even though it wasn't in the send history, it was still in the arrival history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000292)
The sent mail itself had reached the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A2)
What does this mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B2)
Isn't that a time paradox?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C2)
Is that the reason why everyone else went through "memory modification"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D2)
Why were their memories modified in the first place...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E2)
If you say it's the butterfly effect, then that's the end of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F2)
Changing the past changed the world-- using Titor's words, when divergence changes, aren't people's memories reconstructed to match that "changed world line"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000302)
Then how come only my memories of the past world line continue even after the past changed?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000352)
My intracerebral meeting is interrupted by an incoming mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000362)
...Tch, don't get in my way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000372)
I think since it's a mail, I can just leave the response to later, so I concentrate on drinking coffee.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000382)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B4)
This frequency...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C4)
No doubt about it. It's got to be another serial mail strike from Kiryuu Moeka, otherwise known as Shining Finger-- by me, anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D4)
She's really annoying when it comes to mail, huh....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E4)
Even though she doesn't talk at all. Her character's way too fickle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E4)
I sigh as I reluctantly check the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
【Rintaro】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
She wants to send a D-mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
That reminds me, yesterday, I assigned Moeka Lab Mem Number 005.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
So she's a lab mem too. She's more than qualified to participate in the experiment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000864)
Moeka seems serious, so she might meet my demands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000874)
Most importantly, all the other lab mems are completely useless when it comes to D-mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000884)
I still haven't been able to verify whether or not I can remember other people changing the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000894)
【Rintaro】
Wait, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000938)
I'm worried.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000948)
Moeka works for an editorial company. In other words, she's related to the media.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000958)
What if she sends a D-mail and leaks this breakthrough of the century?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000968)
We'll be flooded by interviewers and gone will be the days of the media not noticing me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000978)
Conversely speaking, it'll give out our location to the "Organization".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000988)
Ignoring the danger to my body, it's not bad to have a means of making our grand announcement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000998)
But in that case, I'd rather choose a national newspaper or TV interviewer to cover the event rather than some shady, unknown editorial company.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A8)
That way, it'll spread faster throughout Japan, nay, the world. Whichever way I choose, I don't feel like it's a good plan to use Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8A)
That's right, Moeka is a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9A)
Yesterday, we told her everything about the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and D-mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAA)
Moreover, we made her our comrade.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABA)
We had to do so to prevent a leak.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADE)
Feeling there's no meaning in denying Moeka her request, I put my phone to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEE)
【Rintaro】It's me. ...yeah, I hesitated just a little. ...What? You can tell by my voice? Hmph, I'm no match for you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFE)
【Rintaro】So, about whether or not I should bring Shining Finger into the Microwave Ophone (Temp) experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0E)
【Rintaro】...Wha, ridiculous, you want me to offer her as a sacrifice? Certainly, I am prepared to make sacrifices if it's for the cause of visiting chaos on the world, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1E)
【Rintaro】...No, no problem. Rather, I was pathetic to have hesitated. Maybe I'm not cut out to be a mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2E)
【Rintaro】...Yeah, this offer can be called a revelation for me. It could be Steins;Gate's choice. El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3E)
With that said, I reply to Moeka's mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E54)
After sending my mail, I hurry back to the lab.
