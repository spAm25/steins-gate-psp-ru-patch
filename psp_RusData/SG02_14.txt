What? All I can hear is noise. Wrong number?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090C)
No, perhaps--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091C)
【Rintaro】It's the "Organization", right? Is this a warning? You telling me to stop getting involved with SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000938)
【Kurisu?】Haah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000960)
Hm? It's a woman's voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000970)
Furthermore, she's responding to my words with a dumb voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000980)
【Rintaro】You're not from the "Organization"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099C)
【Kurisu?】...No. It's Makise.

【Rintaro】Makise...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C8)
Who...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D8)
I think I remember this voice from somewhere...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E8)
【Rintaro】Sorry, but I don't remember. Tell me where we met. Paris? London--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A04)
【Kurisu2】Akihabara. And we just met yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAE)
Yesterday?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABE)
Makise... Makise...

【Rintaro】Oh, Assistant!

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
【Kurisu】Not your assistant! Makise Kurisu!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEC)
【Rintaro】If you don't say Christina, then I have no way of knowing it's you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C08)
【Kurisu】I'm not Christina either. How many times do I have to tell you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C24)
【Rintaro】You're yapping your trap off like always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C40)
【Kurisu】Whose fault is that? Whose?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5C)
【Rintaro】Just wait, why do you know my phone number...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6C)
This is unnatural... Kurisu hasn't cleared any doubts that she might be a spy--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C88)
【Kurisu】I got Hashida-san to tell me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA4)
【Rintaro】Oh, that's boring. So, what is it, Assistant?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC0)
【Kurisu】I said I'm not your assistant, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD0)
【Kurisu】Haah, it's stupid to object. Where are you now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEC)
【Rintaro】I'm about to head out to Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D08)
【Kurisu】Ah, okay. Bye then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5E)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6E)
【Rintaro】Eh? Haah!? What was that!? She hate me!? Does she hate me!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8A)
How dare a mere assistant look down on me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9A)
I need to be careful next time I meet her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAA)
She got her thesis published in "Science" after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2A)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3A)
【Rintaro】...You got your thesis published in "Science", so what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4A)
【Kurisu】What's this all of a sudden?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5A)
Assistant's standing in front of Yanabayashi Shrine for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6A)
She glares at me with a sour look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7A)
【Rintaro】What was with that phone call?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F94)
【Kurisu】I just wanted to ask your whereabouts. And since you said you were coming here, I came.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA4)
【Rintaro】Nobody called you, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB4)
【Kurisu】I don't remember being called, either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC4)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDE)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEE)
Why is she always pouting?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109A)
【Rintaro】Why did you come to meet me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001148)
【Kurisu】It's not like I came because I wanted to meet you. Don't get me wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011EC)
She just keeps those abusive words coming.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129A)
【Kurisu】...What you said yesterday as we split up got on my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133E)
【Rintaro】What part?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E2)
【Kurisu】The IBN 5100. And SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001486)
【Rintaro】So, you weren't an "Organization" spy, but a SERN spy!? You came to kill me, didn't you!? That's what I thought! Since you have the face of a killer!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001534)
【Kurisu】What about my face? How rude!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E2)
【Kurisu】Can you calm down a bit? You're always screwing around. You really don't look like you're older than I am.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001686)
【Rintaro】Calm down, huh... Hmph, you don't understand. My body is constantly exposed to danger, and I've lived my entire life running and running.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001734)
【Kurisu】Ehh, I don't get any of that idle talk at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D8)
【Rintaro】You come to pick a fight?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001886)
【Kurisu】I'm just interested in how the IBN 5100 and SERN are related.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192A)
【Rintaro】Don't you mean you're more interested in SERN's time machine research? Be honest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D8)
【Kurisu】Sh-shut up. I'm not interested in time machines at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7C)
【Kurisu】More importantly, did you find an IBN 5100?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B20)
【Rintaro】I came here to check that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC4)
Kurisu looks up to Yanabayashi Shrine's smal torii.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C72)
【Kurisu】At the shrine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D16)
【Rintaro】Correct.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DBA)
Then, with perfect timing, a beautiful girl-- er, beautiful boy-- dressed in miko garb appears from the nearby shrine office, holding a bamboo brom.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E96)
【Luka】Ah, Oka...Kyouma-san, hello.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F7A)
【Rintaro】...Lukako, why don't you have it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002028)
【Luka】Eh, umm, are you talking about "Demon Sword Samidare"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020CC)
【Rintaro】I thought I told you to carry it at all times!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000217A)
【Luka】I'm sorry, but, it gets in the way when I'm cleaning, so...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000221E)
【Rintaro】What are you going to do when you get attacked while you're cleaning? Nobody's going to come to your rescue, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022CC)
【Luka】Th-that's true... I'll be more careful from now on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023A8)
【Kurisu】Hey. What are you two talking about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244C)
Finally noticing Kurisu's presence, Lukako looks at me with a puzzled look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024FA)
【Luka】Eh, um... who might this be...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259E)
【Rintaro】Assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000264C)
【Kurisu】No! Wait, what's with that vague introduction!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F0)
【Rintaro】I only told the truth, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002794)
【Luka】She's n-n-not Japanese...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002842)
【Kurisu】I am Japanese.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002904)
【Rintaro】More importantly, Lukako. I need to talk to your father--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000295C)
【Kurisu】Wait! Introduce me! Properly!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000296C)
【Rintaro】You want to be introduced? Properly?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002986)
【Kurisu】It's unnatural to not be introduced in this situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002996)
【Rintaro】I didn't come here to introduce you to Lukako!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B0)
【Kurisu】An introduction wouldn't take more than 10 seconds, yet you keep refusing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F8)
【Luka】Um... fighting is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A08)
Lukako's flustered. Looks like he's misunderstanding our fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A86)
【Rintaro】She's Makise Kurisu. ...My assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA0)
【Kurisu】Yes, whatever. Assistant, whatever... haah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ABA)
【Luka】Nice to meet you, Makise-san. I-I'm Urushibara Luka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AD4)
【Kurisu】Nice meeting you. How old are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE4)
【Luka】17 this year.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AF4)
【Kurisu】A year below me, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B12)
【Luka】Eh, is that so?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B2C)
Makise-san, you're so adult-like, you don't seem just a year older...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B40)
【Rintaro】In other words, you look old.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BF0)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C00)
She glares at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA6)
【Luka】No, that's not it, um, I mean you're very beautiful...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CC0)
【Kurisu】Thanks. I think you're very cute.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CDA)
But he's a guy. I probably shouldn't tell Assistant that, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CEA)
If she were to learn the truth, she might go back to America from the shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CFA)
【Rintaro】Are we done with the dumb diplomacy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D18)
【Kurisu】I'm sick of your complaining.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D28)
【Rintaro】Then, Lukako, I want to talk with your father. Can you call him for me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D42)
【Luka】Yes, I can, but, you need to talk to my father about...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D52)
【Rintaro】Serious business, critical for the future of mankind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D6C)
【Luka】The future...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D86)
【Kurisu】Of mankind?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DA0)
【Luka】I-I'll call him right away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DBC)
Lukako rushes into the shrine office.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DCC)
That kid believes just about everything I say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DDC)
Unlike the rebellious Assistant, he's actually really easy to talk to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EF6)
【Kurisu】shh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F10)
【Kurisu】Oh no, did I catch a cold...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F20)
Kurisu's too busy sniffling for a while to scold me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F3C)
Lukako's father soon apears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F4C)
As for Lukako, he's pretty flustered, so he nearly drags him out to the grounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F94)
【Luka】Father, quickly, quickly...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003014)
【Luka's Father】Wait just a bit. If you rush me so much, I'm going to fall...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000302E)
【Luka】But, the future of mankind depends on it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003048)
【Luka's Father】Oh, oh is that so. That sure is serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030EE)
I've met this father several times before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030FE)
He's a gentle, respectable adult. With the exception of how he raised Lukako wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000310E)
This father dotes upon his son.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000311E)
It seems like Lukako wears miko garb when helping with shrine duties because of his father's request. Maybe he's a pervert. No, I don't mean to mock the Shinto priesthood at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031F6)
【Luka's Father】Ah, Hououin-kun. It's been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003206)
【Rintaro】No, the honor is mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000324E)
【Kurisu】...His name isn't Hououin, it's Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003268)
【Luka's Father】Eh, is that so?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003278)
【Rintaro】Assistant! You're making things complicated, so don't talk!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003292)
【Kurisu】Didn't I just say the truth?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032A2)
Tch, just what did she come here for?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032C0)
【Luka's Father】Luka told me that he was Hououin-kun, so I completely believed it, but, hmm, maybe Luka was just playing a trick on me. Hahaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003308)
【Luka】Ah, Father, th-that's not it, Okabe-san is his real name, and the Hououin name is, umm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003318)
【Rintaro】I am Hououin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003360)
【Kurisu】Okabe Rintaro was the name your parents gave to you, right? Are you denying that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003370)
【Rintaro】Just be quiet, the Zombie!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000338E)
【Kurisu】Who's the Zombie!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033A8)
【Luka's Father】Hahaha, it's great that you all get along.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033B8)
Luka's dad looks at Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033C8)
【Luka's Father】Are you one of Luka's friends too? Please get along with Luka from now on too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033E2)
【Kurisu】Eh, I'm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033F2)
【Luka's Father】Because this child is very delicate, as you can see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000340C)
【Luka】F-father, stop it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003434)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003444)
Kurisu's making a teary face for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003454)
What's wrong? Is it that much of a bother to be called Lukako's friend when she's not?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000346E)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000348A)
Noticing my glance, Kurisu quickly turns away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034DA)
【Luka's Father】So, Hououin-kun. Did you need me for something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003578)
That's right. This isn't the time for carefree chatter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003588)
This is a decisive event for the Operation "Ragnarok"!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003598)
The future of mankind is, well, whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035A8)
For I am a mad scientist, not a hero of any sort.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000360C)
I explain to Luka's dad about how I absolutely need the precious PC, the IBN 5100, no matter what.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000361C)
On top of that, I ask him if that retro PC is dedicated here in Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000362C)
Of course, I don't disclose the classified information that we plan to hack SERN or that this is all related to time machine research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003646)
【Luka's Father】I don't know if "dedicated" is the right word to use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003656)
【Luka's Father】But there certainly is an old computer entrusted to this shrine about 9 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000366C)
【Rintaro】Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000367C)
I become speechless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000368C)
No way, really...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036A8)
【Rintaro】That's it! That's no doubt it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C2)
【Luka's Father】Please wait for a while. I'll go get it now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F2)
Luka's dad comes back in about 10 minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003702)
His face is bright red as he carries a large cardboard box.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003712)
His gait is fairly unsteady. I wonder if he'll be okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003766)
【Luka's Father】Whew, it was hard to look for it. I think this is probably it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003776)
Luka's dad places the box on the ground, taking a deep breath as he rubs his back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003786)
Is it that heavy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003796)
I thank him and take a look inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037EA)
【Rintaro】This is an IBN 5100...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037FA)
Contained inside is a simple computer with an integrated monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000380A)
I say monitor, but it's only about as big as a car GPS screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000381A)
I compare it with the IBN 5100 image I got from Shining Finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000382A)
It looks very similar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038B6)
【Luka】Ah, please look here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038CE)
Lukako points to the logo placed between the <DICT>tape drive</DICT> and the monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038DE)
It clearly says "IBN 5100 Portable Computer".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038EE)
【Rintaro】Fuhaha, fuuhahahaha! Finally, I have elucidated Akiba's urban legend!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003908)
This very computer is the phantom PC of Akiba!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003918)
It's in favorable condition. There's only a thin layer of dust on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003928)
However, it looks like we need to plug it in to test if it works or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003938)
Now, the problem is whether Luka's dad will lend it to me or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003994)
【Rintaro】Urushibara-shi. I'd like to ask bluntly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039A4)
【Rintaro】But could I borrow this computer?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039B4)
【Luka's Father】You may.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039C4)
【Rintaro】That easily!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039D4)
Is it okay for a priest to lend dedicated objects to other people?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E4)
I've never heard anything like that. That's why I was expecting he'd refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039F4)
【Luka's Father】When this was entrusted to us, the owner said this:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A0E)
【Luka's Father】"If a young person appears saying they need the computer no matter what, you may at that time gladly lend it to them."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A1E)
【Luka's Father】I didn't think one would actually appear like this. Actually, I forgot about it until those rumors started popping up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A38)
【Luka's Father】Therefore, let's lend it to Hououin-kun. However, once you're done, please be sure to return it, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A48)
【Rintaro】Yes, thank you very much!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AE6)
While bowing deeply, I snicker in my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AF6)
Heheheh, I can't stop laughing. Things are going so swimmingly. It's almost like things are being prepared for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B06)
With this, SERN's hidden secrets are fully exposed.

We can expose their wicked research, and possibly, even gather hints on the creation of a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B26)
And then I can complete the first time machine in human history before them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BD8)
With that said, now I have to bring the IBN 5100 back to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BE8)
But unfortunately, I don't have a car to transport it. In fact, I don't even have a license.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF8)
Assistant is the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C60)
【Rintaro】Don't you usually get your license at age 16 in America? Yet you don't have one?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C70)
【Kurisu】What, there a problem? Over there, I've been doing nothing but research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C80)
【Rintaro】You're wasting your youth away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C9A)
【Kurisu】I don't think that when I look at you. Actually, I think I'm spending mine more usefully.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CAA)
Damn Assistant. Touche.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CF2)
【Luka】Uh, umm, it's not good to fight...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D02)
Lukako's flustered again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D12)
【Rintaro】Lukako, you were a lifesaver today. Thank your father again for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D22)
Luka's dad had already returned to the shrine office.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D32)
Lukako nods at my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D4C)
【Kurisu】Your father sure is a lovely man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D66)
【Luka】Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D76)
Lukako and I freeze at Assistant's nonchalant words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D90)
【Luka】M-my father is m-married... a-ad-adultery... isn't good...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DAA)
【Kurisu】Huh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DBA)
【Rintaro】I see, Assistant. So you like old men, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD4)
【Kurisu】Hey, wait! Don't misunderstand, you two. That's not what I meant!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DEE)
【Luka】I-I won't give up my father...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DFE)
【Kurisu】P-please don't cry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E0E)
【Kurisu】What I meant was that you and your father get along, so I was jealous. That's all I meant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E28)
【Luka】Eh, ah, was that so.... Im sorry for the weird misunderstanding...! I did something so rude...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E42)
【Kurisu】So don't cry. We resolved the misunderstand, so it's all okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E52)
【Rintaro】...but in the depths of your heart are feelings for Luka's dad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E70)
【Kurisu】There aren't any.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E8C)
Christina turns away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E9C)
I stop myself since angering her any further could lead to violence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EEC)
【Rintaro】Lukako, don't forget your practice swinging with "Samidare".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F06)
【Luka】Y-yes sir. I'll do my best... Umm, El Psy Congaly...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F16)
【Rintaro】It's Congroo! Don't forget it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F30)
【Luka】I-I'm sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F78)
【Kurisu】Hey, it's terrible to bully girls, don't you think?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F88)
No, I don't think that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040EA)
Because Lukako is a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004194)
Ignoring Christina's retort, I lift up the box with the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041A4)
【Rintaro】Hmm, ...gah, it's heavy!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041BC)
It'll take everything I've got to carry this weight all the way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041CC)
I put it down for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041DC)
Now I know why Luka's dad's face was bright red when he carried this thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004252)
【Luka】Is it that heavy...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004262)
【Kurisu】How weak. Even though it's only as big as a CRT monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004272)
【Rintaro】Then why don't you try carrying it? You'll understand that I wasn't wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000428E)
Kurisu sighs, holds both ends of the cardboard box, and puts in all her strength--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000429E)
【Kurisu】Wheugh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042B8)
After giving it her all without lifting it a centimeter, Kurisu gives up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004300)
【Kurisu】...I-it's really heavy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004310)
With a sour look on her face, she blushes slightly in embarrassment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004320)
Assistant seems to have a strong competitive spirit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000433A)
【Kurisu】This thing's gotta weigh like 30 kilos, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000434E)
【Kurisu】Maybe we should've borrowed a push cart.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004368)
 Urushibara-san, is there one in the shrine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000437C)
【Luka】Umm, there is one, but actually, it's broken... I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000438C)
【Kurisu】I see. Is there some other place we could borrow--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000439C)
【Rintaro】No, we don't need a push cart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043EC)
【Kurisu】Then how are you going to bring it back? It takes about 10 minutes to walk back to your run-down lab from here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043FC)
【Rintaro】It may be too heavy for one person, but it's a different story for two. You and I just need to carry it together. That's the reason you're my assistant, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004416)
【Kurisu】Is that the reason...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004426)
【Kurisu】Well, if both of us carry it, we might be able to manage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044DC)
【Kurisu】Nope.avi
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044EC)
【Rintaro】...eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045FA)
【Kurisu】I-I said no.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000460A)
【Rintaro】Didn't you say nope.avi?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004624)
【Kurisu】Sh-shut up. Yes. I said no.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004634)
...Could she possibly be an @channeler?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004652)
【Kurisu】From the start, you made me a lab mem to "borrow my knowledge".
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000466C)
So I'll guide you to the next answer in this case. "I won't do physical labor".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004680)
【Rintaro】I see. Then there's no helping it. For now, I'll do my best to carry it, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046C8)
I glimpse at Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047E2)
Lukako twitches as he notices my glance, timidly raising his hands with a tearful face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047F2)
【Luka】Um, th-then, I will...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000480C)
【Kurisu】Eh? Urushibara-san will? You okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000481C)
【Luka】Yes, I-I'll do my best.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000486C)
【Rintaro】No, Lukako. I shouldn't make you help me. I can manage by myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000487C)
【Luka】No... no way. Please don't hold back. I want to be helpful for Okabe-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000488C)
【Rintaro】No, I'll do it myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000489C)
【Luka】I-I'll help you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048E4)
【Kurisu】Th-then, umm... me too....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004900)
【Rintaro】Please, by all means.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A1A)
【Kurisu】Eh? Wha!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A2A)
【Rintaro】Fuhahaha! Didn't you know, Christina? That was what you call a Japanese Gag!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A44)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A8C)
【Rintaro】Lukako, thanks for the backup! With that said, Assistant and I will carry this computer, so you don't have to help. Thanks for the concern.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AA6)
【Luka】Ah, okay... if that's how it is, then...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AB6)
【Rintaro】Now, Assistant! Since you volunteered yourself, I won't let you refuse. Hold it. Hold it now!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AD0)
【Kurisu】...Okay, okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B4E)
Kurisu and I lift up the cardboard box.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B5E)
Two people collaborating considerably reduces the weight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B6E)
【Kurisu】Why do we have to be face to face?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B7E)
We're positioned so that we're looking at each other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B8E)
But there's no other way to hold it, so there's no helping it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B9E)
【Rintaro】Let's just go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004BF2)
I start to walk out of the shrine at once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C02)
【Kurisu】Hey, wait, wait! Wait!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C2A)
【Rintaro】You're a noisy one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C3A)
【Kurisu】Don't walk forwards. That means I have to walk backwards, right? Move sideways.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C4A)
【Rintaro】Just move quickly, Assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004CB8)
【Kurisu】Hey, listen, please, just listen! Walking backwards is just too much!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004CC8)
【Rintaro】If you're an assistant, you should be able to do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004CD8)
【Kurisu】Thanks for the esteem. But it's too much! I'm asking you to go sideways! No, I'm telling you to go sideways! Sideways! I'm going to fall!
