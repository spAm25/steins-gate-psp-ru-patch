#WRITE(PTR, $000001AE)
We need to work on the problems that we put on hold.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001BE)
Specifically, the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001CE)
I want to find out the secret behind it's mysterious function.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001DE)
Recently, I asked Daru to connect the Microwave Ophone (Temp) to the PC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001EE)
He finished setting it up yesterday, and now he's doing the wiring in the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000278)
【Rintaro】Hey, Daru. Why the <DICT>X68000</DICT>?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000288)
It's a machine that's older than 20 years and has extremely low specs...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D0)
【Itaru】Obviously because it's romance, hurr.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E8)
【Rintaro】So, it's the same reason as for certain Japanese protagonists being <DICT>odd-eyed</DICT>?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000302)
【Itaru】Not getting you, bro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000312)
【Rintaro】Romance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032C)
【Itaru】Well, if it's romance, then I guess it can't be helped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033C)
【Itaru】In any case, there weren't any other PCs I could use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000034C)
【Rintaro】What about your newest one?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000366)
【Itaru】Don't screw around. If I connected my PC to something this ridiculous, it might stop functioning properly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000376)
What a selfish guy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000386)
Also, we're the ones who made Microwave Ophone (Temp), so I'd like it if he didn't call it "ridiculous".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A0)
【Itaru】So, did you do research on the gellification?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B0)
【Rintaro】Yeah, I went to the university this morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C0)
Yes, I went to the university in the middle of the summer holidays to find out why and under what conditions the banana became gelatinous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003D0)
【Rintaro】By looking through a microscope, I found out that it was shredded at the molecular level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EA)
【Itaru】Shredded?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000402)
【Rintaro】It didn't look like the result of a <DICT>phase transition</DICT>. It became something that wasn't an actual banana...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041C)
【Itaru】It... can't be corrosion, right? It's not possible for corrosion to occur in only 2 minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000434)
【Rintaro】...I just remembered <DICT>fractal structures</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000044C)
【Itaru】<DICT>Menger's sponge</DICT>, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000045C)
【Rintaro】Yes. It looked like infinite fractal-shaped holes opened up in the banana at the nano level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000476)
【Itaru】Isn't that dangerous? What is happening here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000486)
【Rintaro】...I have one hypothesis.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000496)
As if to put on an air of importance, I become silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B0)
Daru gulps down his saliva.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C0)
【Rintaro】The hypothesis is that it's the effect of the microwave oven's electromagnetic waves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DA)
【Itaru】Eh, what do you mea--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EA)
【Rintaro】The Microwave Ophone (Temp) has the potential to become a powerful weapon of mass destruction. We can rewrite the history of war. Kukuku.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FA)
I distort my lips to look evil.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000050A)
Then, after taking out my cellphone, I put it against my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000534)
【Rintaro】...It's me. The plan has reached the second stage... Yes, they will know about it in due time. The Judgement Day Grand Punishment is close.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000544)
【Rintaro】Everything is the will of Steins;Gate, mankind cannot oppose it. El Psy Congroo
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000564)
【Itaru】Quit talking with your fairies. I'm done with the connecting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000574)
I want to explain to him that I'm not speaking to fairies, but I can't do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000584)
If I were to reveal their identity, I would be treated as a traitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000594)
Then I would become the enemy of other troublesome opponents, while still fighting the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000069E)
Now that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is covered in wires, it really does look ridiculous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074A)
Even though we only connected it to the PC, the result looks like the work of something evil.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F6)
The reason we did this connection is to allow us to control the business purpose <DICT>terminal modes</DICT> and to observe the oven's operation status.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D2)
【Itaru】So, what shall we do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000976)
【Rintaro】Prepare the bananas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
Before I left "MayQueen+Nyan⑯", Mayuri asked me to buy bananas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5C)
The money that I used to buy them belongs to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
What a tractable girl. I don't know whether to call her a nonchalant idiot or just softhearted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAE)
She can't even predict that if she lets me buy the bananas, I will only use them up for experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D90)
And so, I put the bunch of bananas into the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3E)
【Itaru】If you use it all, Mayushi will be sad, y'know? You bought the bananas with her money, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE2)
【Rintaro】The money that she gave were research funds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F86)
【Itaru】Anyway, you don't have to use the whole thing, bro. Just 1 is enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001036)
Daru plucks a single banana from the bunch and places it inside the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DA)
【Rintaro】We can't reconstruct the world's ruling structure if we are stingy with money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B6)
【Itaru】You're the only one who wants to reconstruct it or whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000125A)
He lost all enthusiasm upon coming back to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001310)
What an inconsistent guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001376)
【Itaru】Come on, start the timer with your cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BE)
Now, where did I put it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013DC)
Phone, phone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153E)
Calling complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000154E)
An instant connection.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156A)
【Mayuri2】R-E-N-G. This is the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001586)
The Mayushii Guidance begins.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A2)
【Mayuri2】From here, you can control the timer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B2)
【Mayuri2】After entering #, please input the heating time in seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CE)
【Rintaro】We're gonna have to add a skip function to the Mayushii Guidance. Waiting like this is irritating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EA)
【Mayuri2】For example, 1 minute would be "#60".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FA)
【Mayuri2】2 minutes would be "#120".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001616)
The guidance is finally over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001626)
I shall input "120#".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001662)
Once I enter the symbols, the Microwave Ophone (Temp) begins working, emitting a low buzzing sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AA)
【Itaru】You've done it wrong, bro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
Crap, this is normal heating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E8)
I return the timer to 0, and restart from the beginning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F8)
I have to disregard the guidance and input "120#".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170C)
Crap, I made a mistake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171C)
Let's try again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172C)
Ignore the guidance and input "120#".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001740)
Inputting complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001762)
The turntable inside the Microwave Ophone starts rotating in the opposite direction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
【Rintaro】2 minutes sure is a long time...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
We don't even know if it really must be 2 minutes, but this was the setting the first time that Mayuri discovered the "freezing" function, so we use it in our experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
Of course, we tried 60 and 180 seconds, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
If we set it shorter than 120, the freezing either stops halfway or nothing happens at all, while setting it longer makes the changes even larger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EA)
【Itaru】But, if it happens because of the electromagnetic waves, shouldn't it affect our cells, too?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FA)
After being silent for a while, Daru asks that question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180A)
【Rintaro】Well, did you ever try heating yourself in the Microwave Ophone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001824)
【Itaru】There's no way I could fit there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001834)
【Itaru】Anyway, what's the sauce on this being the effect of the electromagnetic waves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001844)
【Rintaro】If I were to put it to words... The intuition of a mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185E)
【Itaru】Oh, so there's no basis for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186E)
【Rintaro】Edison once said that "If there's no 1％ inspiration, the 99％ perspiration is wasted. That's why, inventor, be inspired!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
【Itaru】Wasn't it "Genius is 1％ inspiration, 99％ perspiration"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001898)
【Rintaro】No. In the recent years, it has become widely known that that quote is wrong. Fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A8)
【Itaru】So you're telling me that Edison said "be inspired!"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B8)
【Rintaro】Yes, "be inspired!".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C8)
I don't know if that was exactly what he said, but I'm sure it was something along those lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D8)
I only found this out recently on a wiki.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E8)
【Rintaro】Therefore I, a genius mad scientist, am always--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001914)
The Microwave Ophone (Temp) lets out a sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001924)
【Rintaro】Now that I think about it, by doing this, the banana will only become gelatinous again and we won't discover anything new.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001934)
I now feel like I wasted 120 seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001950)
Daru opens up the door of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and looks inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001960)
Wha-, what is he disturbed about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001970)
【Itaru】Oh... Woahhh!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001980)
He's rubbing his eyes, blinking like crazy and is tilting his head in puzzlement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001990)
【Rintaro】What are you doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D8)
【Itaru】No, ehmm... huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019E8)
【Itaru】...It's gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F8)
【Rintaro】What's gone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A08)
【Itaru】The banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A24)
What the hell is he saying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A34)
Not understanding the situation, I push Daru aside and look inside the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A90)
【Rintaro】...Gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA0)
...It's not here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB0)
The inside is completely empty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC0)
The banana that we put inside just about 120 seconds ago disappeared without a trace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE8)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
I take out my phone after a short sigh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B22)
And start speaking to the silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B32)
【Rintaro】...It's me. The situation became troublesome. Apparently, we have woken up something outrageous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7A)
【Itaru】W-what do you mean by "something outrageous"!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
Daru is panicking besides me, but I ignore him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
My heart is beating fast due to the astonishment, but I try to look calm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
【Rintaro】Put the emergency order number 666, "The Grim Seal Cooling-Off" into operation right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC6)
【Rintaro】What!? Government approval!? Are you stupid? There's no time for that! If this keeps up, the country is gonna blow up!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BDC)
After yelling, I put away my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C24)
【Itaru】...T, talking to yourself, derp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C34)
【Rintaro】Shut up you Faris' stalker. So, where did you hid the banana?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4E)
【Itaru】Who're you calling a stalker!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5E)
【Rintaro】Take out the BA NA NA, right now. Are you planning on becoming a street magician or something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C78)
【Itaru】YOU'RE the one who hid it, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C88)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
【Itaru】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA8)
An uncomfortable silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB8)
I just realized that my throat is all dried up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC8)
【Rintaro】Why did it disappear!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE2)
【Itaru】I dunno!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3E)
【Rintaro】Where did you go, banaana! BANAANAAA!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4E)
I take out the turntable of the microwave oven and look all over it, but I can't find a single trace of the banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5E)
【Rintaro】I, I got it... So this wasn't an electromagnetic wave weapon, but a microwave oven which allows teleportation...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DBA)
【Itaru】W, whaaat-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD4)
【Itaru】...But that's nonsense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE4)
【Rintaro】There's no other way the banana could've disappeared from the closed space of the microwave oven!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DFE)
【Itaru】Ehmm, for now, we should calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E0E)
【Rintaro】Y, yeah. That's right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E1E)
We both take deep breaths.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E2E)
Right, I will eat a banana to calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4A)
I extend my hand towards the banana bunch while thinking that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E5A)
--And I start doubting my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA2)
【Rintaro】Wh... at...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB2)
This is truly unnatural.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC2)
The banana bunch that Mayuri asked me to buy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED2)
About 3 minutes ago, Daru picked a banana from it and put it in the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE2)
...Or so it should've been.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF2)
But now, there's not even a trace of a banana ever being picked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F02)
And instead of it, there's a gelified banana, perfectly connected to the rest of the bunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F4A)
【Itaru】Wh, what the hell!? What's happening here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F5A)
Looks like Daru noticed, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6A)
In a state of confusion, I tried to touch it, but restrained myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F7A)
【Rintaro】Daru, how many bananas are there in the lab right now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F94)
【Itaru】P, probably only these...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA4)
【Rintaro】
Is the place where the gelbana is right now the same place where you took the banana from?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB4)
【Itaru】I, I dunno... I didn't confirm that much...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FCE)
【Itaru】This gelbana is perfectly connected...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FDE)
Yes, perfectly connected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FEE)
I don't see any damage or anything else.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FFE)
Besides being gelified, it looks very natural. It doesn't look like a trick at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200E)
By which I mean that it doesn't seem like someone took a banana, gelified it, and then put the banana back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000202A)
【Rintaro】H, hey, Daru... Could this...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C8)
The words that I previously said out of nowhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D8)
Now, I have trouble even whispering them again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E8)
However, I must say it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F8)
No matter how unbelievable this is, I saw it with my own eyes...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002108)
My head is full of question marks, and I don't even know how this happened, but if I were to explain it with only what I saw, then this is---
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002118)
From the closed space of the Microwave Ophone (temp) to the bunch of bananas--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000217C)
【Rintaro】Be an actual... Teleportation...!?
