I want to take her to the hospital, but I don't say it.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046C)
The time of Mayuri's death steadily approaches.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047C)
I can only ask Suzuha to bear with it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000048C)
So no passersby worry, I wrap a towel around her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A0)
【Mayuri】Ah, Okarin, welcome home-. Suzu-san's with you too, huh-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B0)
When we get to the lab, Mayuri and Daru are there for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C0)
I thought I sent them home...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D0)
When I ask, Mayuri optimistically answers this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E0)
【Mayuri】After all, we should celebrate Super Microwave Ophone-chan's completion-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005FA)
【Mayuri】And so I went shopping with Daru-kun and came back-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060A)
She really can't read the atmosphere...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000061A)
Kurisu, also with a stumped look on her face, whispers into my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EE)
【Kurisu】Wh-what do we do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FE)
【Rintaro】Make absolutely sure Mayuri doesn't find out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070E)
Kurisu nods softly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071E)
【Itaru】What are you guys whispering about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072E)
【Kurisu】Ah, ummm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000073E)
【Rintaro】How many times do I have to say it? We won't celebrate!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000846)
【Mayuri】Ehh-. Okarin, you're so unsociable-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000856)
【Rintaro】That's not the issue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000866)
I glance at Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000876)
She's still depressed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000886)
【Mayuri】Suzu-san, you don't look good. What's wrong-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000896)
【Rintaro】Christina, Suzuha, and I have important matters to discuss. So you two, please leave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A6)
【Mayuri】Mayushii wants to hear too-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C0)
【Itaru】No, Mayu-shi, I think you need to read the atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DA)
【Mayuri】But... Suzu-san looks down. Mayushii's kind of worried about her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008EA)
【Suzuha】...Sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C6)
Suzuha hangs her head while biting her lip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D6)
I guess she feels responsible for Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
How is Suzuha related to Mayuri's death? I should find that out soon--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
【Suzuha】I want Shiina Mayuri and Hashida Itaru to hear too. This talk concerns them too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A06)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A16)
If Suzuha says so, then I have no objections.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A26)
But I remind her not to let them know that Mayuri dies in a few hours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B42)
Suzuha tells them about her true identity. That the satellite is a time machine. That she posted on @channel as John Titor. That she came from 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD4)
【Itaru】A future girl, wow-. Fascinating. Can I shake your hand?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE4)
【Rintaro】Daru. We're not playing around here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFE)
【Mayuri】Suzu-san, what year were you born-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0E)
【Suzuha】2017
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D22)
【Mayuri】That's in seven years-. You haven't been born yet but you're here-.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3C)
 Hmm, uhhhmmmm???
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D50)
Let's leave the confused Mayuri aside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA0)
【Rintaro】So, Suzuha. Can you give us the details?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB0)
【Suzuha】Well, what I posted as Titor is just about everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC0)
【Suzuha】I came from future, 2036. In that era, SERN's ruling dystopia eradicated all strife, but also stole away all personal freedoms.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E10)
【Mayuri】Diss-tope-ear?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E58)
【Kurisu】An extremely regulated society. Totalitarianism.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E68)
【Kurisu】Even if Mayuri wants to eat a banana, she isn't allowed to if today isn't a banana eating day. If she does eat one then she's put in jail without trial. That sort of society.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E82)
【Mayuri】That's terrible-. Mayushii loves bananas...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E92)
Forget about bananas...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEA)
【Suzuha】And I fight to free the world from SERN's rule as part of the <DICT>Resistance</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFA)
【Suzuha】The reason I time traveled to this era... is to change that "present"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0A)
【Suzuha】It's the future for you guys, I guess. To change the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1A)
To change... the future...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2A)
She doesn't look like she's joking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7A)
【Mayuri】So then, what about searching for your father-? Was that a lie...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8A)
【Suzuha】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9A)
Suzuha doesn't answer that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAA)
Meaning it was a lie?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF2)
【Kurisu】SERN is a research institution, not a governing institution with political power. I complained about that to John Titor online many times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001002)
What...? Online...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001012)
【Rintaro】...ah, don't tell me, you're "KuriGohan and Kamehameha"!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102C)
Kurisu turns away her sour reddened face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
【Kurisu】Titor named himself, so it wouldn't be fair unless I did too, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
【Rintaro】In that case, I'll come clean too. I, using the name of Hououin Kyouma--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D2)
【Kurisu&Suzuha (K)】I know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E2)
【Kurisu&Suzuha (S)】I know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001136)
【Mayuri】Ah, you harmonized-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001146)
Suzuha put on a slightly disturbed face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001156)
I guess she didn't like harmonizing with Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001166)
She clears her throat and continues speaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B6)
【Suzuha】SERN's still a research institution in 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C6)
【Suzuha】The one who rules the world is SERN's backing group, the Committee of 300.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D6)
【Rintaro】The Committee of 300... is real?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E6)
That name was in SERN's top secret documents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001200)
【Suzuha】When SERN successfully completed their time machine, they became the sole entity who could interfere with the fourth dimension.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001210)
【Suzuha】As a result, they repainted the entire world order in just two years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001220)
To a normal person, it was just two years, but SERN most likely used the time machine to multiply that maybe dozens of times in order to obtain the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123A)
【Suzuha】With that said, Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001282)
Suzuha glares at Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001292)
【Suzuha】In 2036, you're "apotheosized" as the Mother of the Time Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012AC)
【Kurisu】Apotheosized?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012BC)
【Itaru】In Japanese, please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CC)
Apotheosized... Like an apothecary? No, I don't think it's the same root word, so...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E6)
【Suzuha】Apotheosized. As in revered, respected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F6)
That's so hard to understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001306)
She keeps using difficult vocabulary, but is that normal in 2036?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001320)
【Kurisu】Respected? ...Eh!? I-I am!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001330)
【Suzuha】In 2010, you discovered history's first concept of time leaping, and afterwards, you contributed to SERN's time machine development. That's the Makise Kurisu I've heard about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001340)
Is that why you made her your sworn enemy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001350)
【Rintaro】Then that means I'm the "Father of the Time Machine", right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001360)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro is treated as a terrorist. A fairly infamous one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001370)
【Rintaro】eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001380)
Eh, seriously?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001390)
I'm a terrorist!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AA)
【Kurisu】I participated in SERN's time machine development? I don't believe that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BA)
【Kurisu】SERN carried out human experimentation, you know? I have no intention of collaborating with such a disgrace to the scientific community.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
【Suzuha】But that's how it is in the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EE)
【Kurisu】Did the future me say anything?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FE)
【Suzuha】We've never met. Furthermore, in 2036, you're already dea... passed away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001418)
【Kurisu】You just said something dreadful...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001428)
【Kurisu】You mean I don't live past 50?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001442)
【Suzuha】In my time, there are two types of people: ones who live long, and ones who suspiciously die young.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001452)
【Suzuha】People who act against SERN are quickly erased.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146C)
【Kurisu】M-me too...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147C)
Suzuha returns Kurisu's gaze. She doesn't have her usual scowl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001496)
【Suzuha】...Perhaps, you were being used by SERN. Maybe they took both of your parents hostage and forced you to research, for example.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B0)
【Kurisu】...No way. Mama... is in danger?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014CC)
Kurisu's mother is in America. The scenario where SERN kidnaps her mother while Kurisu's in Japan isn't that unlikely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014DC)
I don't laugh it off as something impossible. After all, I saw Moeka kill Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EC)
【Rintaro】Rounders...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001534)
【Itaru】What's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001544)
【Rintaro】SERN's mercenary force, or something like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158C)
Suzuha nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159C)
【Suzuha】On paper, they're just a technical investigation squad independent from SERN. In actuality, they're a "jack of all trades" who carry out villainous roles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AC)
According to Moeka, they have two chief duties.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BC)
The retrieval of the IBN 5100, the only machine that can hack into SERN's hidden database.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CC)
And to crush the world's aspiring time machine researchers and force them to cooperate with SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DC)
【Suzuha】So they exist in this era too, huh. I've always been fighting against the Rounders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F6)
【Itaru】Villainous roles... d-don't tell me it's things like kidnapping and assassination...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001610)
【Suzuha】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001620)
Suzuha looks to me, asking whether she should answer or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001630)
I shake my head left and right
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001640)
【Suzuha】They do those things in my era. I don't think they've gone that far currently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165A)
Daru's obviously relieved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AA)
【Kurisu】Hey, Amane-san. Just a while ago, you said that what you posted as John Titor was almost all true, didn't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C4)
【Suzuha】That's right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D4)
【Kurisu】So you mean you understand the structure of the world? You wrote that it can be explained with the Everett-Wheeler model or the many-worlds interpretation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016EE)
【Suzuha】That was fake. Camouflage so that SERN wouldn't target me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016FE)
【Suzuha】If I mix one lie into the truth, then the bad apple spoils the barrel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170E)
【Kurisu】So you don't understand it then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171E)
【Suzuha】I do. The world's structure was clarified in 2036. It's not the many-worlds interpretation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001738)
【Kurisu】...Really? Tell me the details!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001748)
【Rintaro】"Attractor Fields"...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001762)
【Suzuha】Correct. I told Okabe Rintaro directly by mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177C)
【Kurisu】What sort of explanation is that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178C)
【Suzuha】The world is made of world lines and "attractor fields".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179C)
Suzuha takes a red yarn ball out of Mayuri's costume sewing set placed on the table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AC)
She holds one end of the yarn and drops the ball to the floor. She stretches out about a meter of the yarn in front of her face to show it to us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BC)
【Suzuha】The world's structure is like "twisted yarn".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182A)
【Suzuha】Several possible worlds are superpositioned, always branching out infinitely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183A)
【Suzuha】The entirety looks like one piece, but at the micro level, the world is organized like thin intertwined threads.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000184A)
【Suzuha】And at the end, those fine threads converge into one. The paths are different, but the ends are the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001862)
【Kurisu】Isn't that <DICT>determinism</DICT>?」
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001872)
【Suzuha】It might be close. But it's a little more rough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001882)
【Suzuha】It sort of cherrypicks from the many-worlds interpretation and the Copenhagen interpretation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001892)
【Rintaro】So, the divergences end the same, meaning there's only one world in the end?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A2)
【Suzuha】Exactly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B2)
【Suzuha】And so, the bundle of world lines within the range of convergence make up an attractor field.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C2)
【Suzuha】There are also several attractor fields.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D2)
【Suzuha】This "twisted yarn" is Attractor Field α. In its range are α World Lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E2)
Suzuha indicates the yarn she's holding while cutting meter lengths of blue, yellow, and white yarn. She creates a multicolored string.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F2)
【Suzuha】Blue is Attractor Field β, yellow is γ, and white is δ.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001902)
【Suzuha】Each has several of their respective β World Lines, γ World Lines, and δ World Lines. And there are hundreds of millions of these.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001912)
She bundles them together and stretches them out again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001922)
The several multicolored yarns intertwine into one fat twisted yarn.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001932)
【Suzuha】Several attractor fields are superpositioned like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001942)
【Suzuha】In each attractor field, the converging result of events is different.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001952)
【Suzuha】They don't interfere. Each remains independent. There's only one if you trace it back to the origin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001962)
【Suzuha】Attractor fields do converge at a very macro level, but that spans hundreds of years. It's best to think of them as large divergences.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F2)
【Itaru】Can you compare it to an eroge? Tell me, oh erotic one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A0C)
【Kurisu】T-there's no erotic one here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A1C)
【Rintaro】Nah, it is just like an eroge. Each heroine's route is an attractor field, and the small choices within are the individual world lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2C)
【Rintaro】But at the end, they all enter the true route for the grand ending.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3C)
【Itaru】The problem is if the common route is long or short. By the way, I'd chose the little sister character's attractor field.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A4C)
【Rintaro】Whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A66)
【Kurisu】...These guys are no good. I need to do something quick.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB6)
【Suzuha】Umm, I don't really understand those eroge things...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC6)
【Kurisu】You don't have to take them seriously...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD6)
Basically...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE6)
The reason I can't save Mayuri no matter how much I struggle is because of the attractor field's special trait-- absolute convergence to a single result?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF6)
Crap...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B06)
That means Mayuri really is being killed by the world...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B16)
【Itaru】But then, isn't it impossible to change the future? It'll converge in the end, right? No matter what you do, the result is the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B26)
That's right. That's why Mayuri gets killed no matter how many times I time leap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B40)
【Suzuha】...We're going to escape outside the scope of this Attractor Field α we're in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B50)
【Rintaro】Outside the scope...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B60)
【Suzuha】Basically, we're going to leap to the β World Line in Attractor Field β.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7A)
【Kurisu】We won't get interfered?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B8A)
【Suzuha】Attractor fields completely diverge. But if we go to the instant they diverge, then...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9A)
【Kurisu】The instant they diverge... Is that now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAA)
【Suzuha】I was taught that a large crossroads in Divergence exists in 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBA)
【Suzuha】An earth-shattering divergence, on par with the ones in 2000 and 1991, occurs, causing branching on the attractor field level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C0A)
【Mayuri】Umm, why 2000 and 1991-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C24)
【Suzuha】Global scale incidents happened on both years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C34)
【Mayuri】Incidents-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C44)
【Rintaro】1991 was the collapse of the USSR, right? But what was in 2000...? If it were 2001, it would be the simultaneous terrorist attacks...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5E)
【Suzuha】2000 had the Year 2000 problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C6E)
【Itaru】Haah? That wasn't as big a problem as it was hyped out to be, was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7E)
【Suzuha】That's because the α World Line we're on is a "possible world where the Year 2000 problem didn't occur".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8E)
So basically, does that mean there are other possible worlds where the Year 2000 problem did occur...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA8)
【Suzuha】And 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC2)
【Mayuri】Did a large event happen this year-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD2)
【Suzuha】This year's momentous event--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE2)
Suzuha looks towards the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF2)
【Suzuha】Can it be anything other than history's first successful time machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D0C)
【Mayuri】Ah, I see-. That's true. Amaaazing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5C)
【Kurisu】Another question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D6C)
Kurisu keeps plowing ahead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D7C)
I guess this one of her scientist traits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9E)
【Kurisu】These superpositioned world lines aren't <DICT>parallel worlds</DICT> are they?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB8)
【Suzuha】No. At the very end, they're just "possible worlds that exist simultaneously".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC8)
【Kurisu】Then how do you observe the differences between world lines? Isn't that impossible without the perspective of a god?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD8)
【Suzuha】That's usually true. But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF2)
Suzuha looks at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E02)
...Don't tell me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E12)
【Rintaro】Reading Steiner!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E22)
【Suzuha】Is that what you named it? Okabe Rintaro, you have the special ability to observe the passage of world lines. Correct?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E32)
【Rintaro】Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E42)
【Suzuha】That's the key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E52)
【Suzuha】Your special ability is the key to release the world from the curse of SERN's rule.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E62)
【Suzuha】Right now, you are an existence rivaling god.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E72)
【Rintaro】...My ability
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E82)
【Suzuha】Outside the scope of Attractor Field α-- If you reach the β World Line... the converging "result" changes too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E92)
My body trembles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA2)
I almost roar from the excitement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB2)
【Rintaro】...Can she be saved?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F02)
Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F12)
Can she be saved?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F22)
Suzuha nods clearly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F32)
Then I just gotta do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F42)
This is the only path.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F52)
All I can do is take Suzuha's proposal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F62)
【Kurisu】Wait a second.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FE0)
But Kurisu's a downer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FF0)
【Kurisu】Is that really all true? Amane-san, did you possible mix in any of your delusions?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200A)
【Suzuha】Wh-what~!? I didn't mix in any delusions!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002024)
【Kurisu】Calm down. I'm not trying to pick a fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002034)
【Kurisu】But I have my doubts. In the first place, how did you know about Okabe's ability, and that Okabe and I were in Akihabara in 2010?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000204E)
【Kurisu】Isn't that a little too detailed for someone born in 2017?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000205E)
That's... true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000206E)
Everyone glances at Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002088)
【Suzuha】...That's what was written in Father's will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002098)
Will...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E8)
【Mayuri】Will? What do you mean-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002102)
【Suzuha】I decided to time travel because I read Father's will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002112)
【Suzuha】Father was one of the founding members of the Resistance and studied time machines separately from SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002122)
【Suzuha】He studied to change the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000213C)
【Suzuha】But... SERN killed Father too...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000214C)
【Suzuha】That's why I'm here, to succeed Father's will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000219C)
【Kurisu】...I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021AC)
【Suzuha】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021BC)
Suzuha doesn't look at Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021CC)
She still seems to have ill will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
Kurisu wouldn't actively cooperate with SERN. I know that, but I couldn't just tell Suzuha off after hearing her heroic past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021EC)
It might be an outburst of anger or scapegoating, but Suzuha really does see Kurisu as the main cause.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021FC)
But if that's the case, why didn't the time traveler Suzuha kill that main cause, Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000220C)
Maybe she couldn't kill her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000221C)
The world converges.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000222C)
No matter how much I struggle, Mayuri dies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000223C)
Similarly, no matter how much Suzuha struggles, she can't kill Kurisu...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000224C)
Suzuha clears her throat as if wanting to change the subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002266)
【Suzuha】Akihabara, 2010. The time machine created here accelerated SERN's own time machine development.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002276)
【Suzuha】It's necessary to obstruct that to guide the course of history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C6)
【Itaru】Obstruct? How?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D6)
【Rintaro】SERN has noticed us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E6)
That's clear from Moeka's attack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002300)
【Suzuha】I believe the main cause is the mail data from the first time you guys used your time machine. That's what Father predicted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002310)
【Rintaro】Mail data...? It wasn't that they caught us hacking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002320)
【Itaru】Like I said, nobody can catch my hacking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002370)
【Kurisu】But, what mail data?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C0)
【Mayuri】Isn't it that thing-? The mail Okarin sent that said Chris-chan died-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D0)
The mail I sent to Daru right after Doctor Nakabachi's conference, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E0)
【Kurisu】Ahh, that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F0)
Back then, we hadn't noticed that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) was a time machine though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002440)
【Suzuha】They probably caught that mail that crossed through time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002450)
【Rintaro】They already caught us back then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002460)
But now that I think about it, the first time I came in contact with Moeka was the day after I sent that mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024DE)
【Itaru】We're swimming in the deep end, aren't we...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F8)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's good at the breaststroke-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002512)
【Itaru】Alright, alright, do a sexy underwater M-shape pose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002562)
【Rintaro】But, just how did they catch us... Hundreds of millions of mails are sent around the world each day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257A)
【Suzuha】SERN uses the <DICT>Echelon</DICT> network to globally gather information on time machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258A)
【Rintaro】Echelon, you say...!? That really exists...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259A)
This is unthinkable information for people who dabble in conspiracy theories, but it doesn't seem like the other lab mems understand the meaning of Echelon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025B4)
【Suzuha】You know, SERN's always observing everyone else's time travel research with Echelon's outstretched antennae.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C4)
Meaning if a mail that crosses through time exists, it wouldn't escape Echelon's sight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D4)
【Suzuha】So you need to take the "first mail data" and delete it from SERN's computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E4)
【Suzuha】If you do that, then SERN won't notice you guys. The time machine won't be completed in 2034. On the contrary, time machine research itself will be at an impasse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F4)
So basically, deleting that data will lead us to the possible world where SERN doesn't make a time machine, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000263C)
【Itaru】Hmm, but when we hacked SERN's database, there wasn't any data like that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002656)
【Suzuha】IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002670)
【Itaru】Ohhh!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002680)
【Rintaro】I see! That database, constructed with IBN 5100s!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002690)
【Suzuha】Inside that is probably Echelon's accumulated data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A0)
That information is in there...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026B0)
【Rintaro】Gh, Daru, why didn't we use the IBN 5100 earlier!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026CA)
【Itaru】But even if you say to use it, we don't have one in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026DA)
【Rintaro】What are you talking about!? Didn't I get one!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F4)
【Itaru】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002704)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002714)
I see. That was before the world line changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002724)
In this world line, I haven't obtained an IBN 5100...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000273E)
【Suzuha】My role is to entrust an IBN 5100 to you guys.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274E)
【Rintaro】Do you have one!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000275E)
Suzuha shakes her head left and right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002778)
【Suzuha】I'm going to 1975 to obtain one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002788)
1975. The year the IBN 5100 went to market.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002798)
I know because the other John Titor who appeared in 2000 also said his goal was to go to 1975 and obtain one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027A8)
I wonder if 2000 Titor was also Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027B8)
Anyway, as long as Suzuha gets an IBN 5100...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027C8)
We'll diverge to a possible world where the time machine isn't made and SERN doesn't catch us--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027D8)
We can leave the current Attractor Field α and go to the β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027E8)
The world line where Mayuri doesn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027F8)
【Rintaro】Alright...! Let's strike while the iron's hot. Let's have Suzuha leap to 1975 immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002812)
【Suzuha】...I really want to, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002822)
Suzuha apologetically hangs her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002832)
A little bit of blood oozes out of her burnt hand onto the towel wrapped around it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002842)
She's hiding it from Mayuri and Daru, but I can see it clearly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002852)
It's painful just looking at it. Maybe we need to take her to a hospital immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002862)
【Rintaro】Your time machine's broken, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B2)
【Kurisu】Can you fix it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C2)
【Suzuha】...I can't. I just rode what Father created.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D2)
【Suzuha】As for the structure itself, I've memorized the manual completely, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E2)
Knowing the structure by the manual is completely different from touching it for yourself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F2)
Having said that, it's not like a time machine from 2036 can be fixed with current technology.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290C)
【Kurisu】What about going back with the Time Leap Machine? To before Amane-san's time machine broke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000295C)
【Itaru】Wait, you're going to use the Time Leap Machine? Wasn't "Do not experiment" our Final Answer?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000296C)
I still haven't told Daru I've time leaped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000297C)
Explaining is also a pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000298C)
【Rintaro】We'll use it depending on the situation. So, Suzuha. Do you know when it broke?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000299C)
【Suzuha】...No. It was probably late night rain from earlier. Since the machine's interior was flooded. Even though it's supposed to be airtight...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029AC)
【Itaru】Don't you think it made a hole back when you made that showy crash?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C6)
【Suzuha】That wasn't a crash. The coordinate calculations were slightly off, so it just "appeared" there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D6)
【Suzuha】That machine is quite unstable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E6)
【Rintaro】So, what day did it rain?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A36)
【Kurisu】The morning of the 10th. It rained just before dawn.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A46)
The Time Leap Machine can only continuously leap back 48 hours, or 2 days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A56)
And the Time Leap Machine was completed today, the 13th at 14 o'clock...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A66)
So no matter how much we try, we can only leap back to the 11th at 14 o'clock...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A76)
【Rintaro】No good, we can't get there with the Time Leap Machine...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A86)
I thought we had a glimmer of hope...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B04)
【Itaru】I think we should try to fix it, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B14)
【Mayuri】That's right-. Since it's a time machine, time doesn't matter much, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B92)
【Suzuha】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BA2)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BB2)
Kurisu, Suzuha, and I say no more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC2)
Because we know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BD2)
In less that two hours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE2)
Death will visit Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C04)
It's already 5:30.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C14)
Mayuri's death is just two hours away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C24)
If we sneak into Radio Kaikan now, we'll just barely make it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C34)
More importantly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C44)
Maybe I should time leap now to 14 o'clock on the 11th to make full use of two days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C54)
【Rintaro】Everyone, you're hungry, right? You should be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD6)
【Itaru】What's this all of a sudden?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF0)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's hungry-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D00)
As expected from a glutton.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D10)
I take a 10,000 yen bill out of my wallet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D20)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, Daru. Go shopping for me. Once we eat, we can start working over our counter plans again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D3A)
【Mayuri】Wawah. Okarin, what are we going to do with all this money-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D4A)
【Rintaro】I'm telling you to buy stuff. Keep the change. Actually, just use it all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D5A)
【Itaru】You can calmly hand over a 10,000 yen bill... wow, Okarin, you can pull of things we can't! That's mind numbing! I love youu!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D76)
With that said, Mayuri and Daru triumphantly leave, having been successfully bribed with 10,000 yen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D86)
【Rintaro】Christina, and you, Titor
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DFC)
【Suzuha】Titor? You mean me...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E0C)
【Rintaro】Who else?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E1C)
【Suzuha】Why did you suddenly change the way you call me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E2C)
【Rintaro】Because you are Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E3C)
【Suzuha】Yeah, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E56)
【Kurisu】It's useless. Okabe rarely calls anyone's name correctly. Just give up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E70)
【Suzuha】That reminds me, he used to call me something weird like "Working Warrior".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E80)
【Rintaro】Listen, you two. I'm going to time leap to the 11th at 14 o'clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E90)
【Rintaro】There, I'll have Titor explain herself again. Moreover, until this time... until the 13th at 17 o'clock, we will do repairs on the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EA0)
【Kurisu】You have a plan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EB0)
【Rintaro】It's better than just struggling for two hours now. If we can't repair it, we can just keep repeating the same two days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ECA)
【Suzuha】...I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EDA)
【Rintaro】Titor. You must absolutely get an IBN 5100 for us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EEA)
【Rintaro】This isn't for you, nor for the future. To the end, you must never forget that this mission is to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EFA)
【Rintaro】You may call me self-righteous if you want. But I--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F0A)
【Rintaro】Won't let anyone tell me what to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F24)
Kurisu and Suzuha give an encouraging nod in agreement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F34)
【Rintaro】Alright. Commence Operations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F4E)
【Kurisu】You're not going to name the operation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F5E)
...Who cares about that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6E)
This isn't a game.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F7E)
Mayuri's life hangs in the balance. There's no time to screw around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F98)
【Kurisu】You couldn't find a good Norse mythology themed name?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FB2)
【Suzuha】Why Norse mythology?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FCC)
【Kurisu】I don't think it has a deep meaning. Isn't it just because our little pretentious hipster bullshitter loves germane names?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FDC)
【Suzuha】Now that you mention it, most of the operation names in the Resistance had germane names too. Whenever I asked, they told me "it's a tradition".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FEC)
【Kurisu】Pretentious hipster bullshit still exists 26 years from now, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FFC)
【Rintaro】Cut the worthless chit chat!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000300C)
Mayuri's life hangs in the balance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000301C)
This isn't the time for such an optimistic conversation!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030C2)
With Kurisu and Suzuha's cooperation-- I leave the 42in Braun tube TV to Suzuha-- we activate the Time Leap Machine before Mayuri gets back.
