#WRITE(PTR, $00000478)
Since Faris' father was also still at home, we settled down in the cafe at UPX.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000488)
Faris ordered a sandwich.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D0)
【Faris】So, does Kyouma have another method in mind, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E0)
【Rintaro】This is only a bet, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004F0)
【Rintaro】We can change the contents of the D-mail you sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000500)
【Faris】So, we're not going to cancel Faris' first prank mail, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000510)
【Rintaro】That's how it's gonna go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000520)
【Rintaro】We win as long as I get the IBN 5100 back. As long as that happens, we don't need to kill your dad--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000530)
Right as I say that, the employee comes to us with our sandwich and drink.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000540)
She's making a startled face at my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000550)
【Rintaro】Uh, we're talking about a game...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000560)
The employee forces a smile and heads back inside after my lame excuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000570)
I turn back to Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000580)
【Rintaro】So, we can end things quickly if we change the D-mail's contents to something like this:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000590)
【Rintaro】"Don't ever let go of the IBN 5100 until you pass it on to Okabe Rintaro".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A0)
I think we can only send the D-mail back 10 years at the most.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B0)
Because cell phone mail didn't become widespread until then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C0)
Lukako's mom's pager was a special case, but even that was still limited to the 1990's.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D0)
So I think it would be impossible to tell Faris' dad in 1975 anything like buy a crapload of IBN 5100's and keep them until 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005EA)
【Faris】But, but, back then, Papa's company was down and he didn't have any money, nya
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005FA)
【Faris】I think there's nyothing you could say to stop him from selling the IBN 5100 if he needed money to save meow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060A)
Faris says so with a troubled face and restlessly stuffs her cheeks with egg sandwich.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000061A)
【Rintaro】That depends on how you write it, right? If you make it seem like it's related to the first D-mail, then your dad has to find another way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000062A)
【Rintaro】If he's a retro PC collector, then he should have plenty of other PCs he could sell, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000063A)
【Faris】He wouldn't get enough money with those, nyan. Back then, the IBN 5100 was the only one people would pay outrageous prices for every neow and then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000064A)
【Rintaro】Then this is something only you can pull off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065A)
【Rintaro】I'll say it again: this is only a bet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066A)
And you might also call it an escape.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067A)
A bet to escape the same responsibilities as god.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000068A)
【Rintaro】How much will the world line change? What will the new world line bring? I don't know the answers either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000069A)
【Rintaro】It may become a world where neither Mayuri nor your dad can be saved, but it may also be one where both can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006AA)
【Rintaro】I'm not confident either. But I can't leave things the way they are. I can't let Mayuri die. I can't let your dad die either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006BA)
It's a gamble. Sink or swim.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006CA)
I'm asking Faris if she's okay with that even when two lives hang in the balance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DA)
I don't want to have to do this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EA)
But I couldn't think of any alternative.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000704)
【Faris】If that's what Kyouma decided... then it's okay with meow too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000714)
【Rintaro】...Really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000724)
【Faris】I know that you're trying to save Papa, nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000734)
【Faris】So I want to give you my thanks, nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074E)
【Faris】I'm really starting to fall in love with Kyouma neow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075E)
【Rintaro】Don't, don't tease me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000778)
【Faris】But I'm not teasing you, nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000788)
Faris pouts her lips in a cute way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A2)
【Faris】Does Kyouma hate women like meow...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B2)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C2)
She peeps at my face with upturned eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D2)
【Rintaro】Th, that's "MayQueen+Nyan⑯"'s number one popular maid for you, huh. She sure knows how to flatter her customers...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EC)
【Faris】...I don't like it when Kyouma dodges meow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007FC)
Now she's dropping her shoulders with a sad face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000080C)
Don't tell me that was a real confession.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000081C)
Faris is cute.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000082C)
My inner insecurities are also largely fading away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000083C)
I don't feel bad being told I'm loved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084C)
I am a man after all. My heart would sway if such a cute girl were to confess to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085C)
But this talk is for times of peace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086C)
Now isn't the time to think about such things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087C)
【Rintaro】Faris... Join me in my gamble.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088C)
【Rintaro】It'll come out all right... believe me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089C)
【Faris】You will never answer Faris' question, nya... sadfrog
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AC)
Faris looks a little downhearted, but after a deep breath, she's smiling again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C6)
【Faris】...Take meow with you, Kyouma. Let's send that D-mail, nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D6)
Our strategy is set.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E6)
Will we hit the jackpot or a land mine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F6)
Not even God knows.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1A)
When I take Faris with me to the lab, Daru weeps tears of joy at her safety.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
Mayuri talks intimately with her, but Kurisu just keeps reading with an unconcerned look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3A)
I told the three of them that I'd explain later - though I don't know if we'd get the opportunity - and head with Faris straight to the experiment room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE6)
I already had Faris write the D-mail's contents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF6)
Faris' staged kidnapping ten years ago became a problem when her dad sold off the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B06)
This is a second threat mail written to prevent that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B16)
Its time of arrival is one hour after the first D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B26)
I set the timer and give Faris a glance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6E)
【Rintaro】There's no turning back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7E)
【Faris】It would be purrfect if I could remember Kyouma even if the world line changes...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8E)
I don't know how that will turn out either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9E)
This isn't like Suzuha's case where we returned the warped world line back to normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAE)
We're warping it even more. I wouldn't be surprised if there are even more changes than the complete annihilation of moe shops from Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBE)
【Rintaro】Even if you forget, I will remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD8)
【Faris】Kyouma, I wannya hold hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE8)
I hold Faris' hand just as she asked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF8)
I activate the Microwave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE6)
【Rintaro】Go for it, Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF6)
【Faris】Sending... nyan
<END>
