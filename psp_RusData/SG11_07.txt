...At last, it starts for real now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB4)
I grip the Cyalume Saber and shake it silently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC4)
Thus activating the red fluorescent paint inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD4)
It will last about 10 minutes. It should get dim before Kurisu appears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE4)
I can clearly see what it is I should do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF4)
But the timing will be severe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C04)
I wonder how well I can dodge the agitated Nakabachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C14)
That should be the most difficult part.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB8)
If I mess up, then Kurisu will be killed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC8)
【Rintaro】What are you so afraid of, Hououin Kyouma?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD8)
【Rintaro】Everything's obviously going as I expected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE8)
I talk to myself as if giving instructions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF8)
【Rintaro】Operation "Skuld" is flawless. After all, I spent fifteen years perfecting this plan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D08)
【Rintaro】I believe in myself. I believe in Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D18)
And I will definitely save Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D72)
I lay in wait in the same cardboard boxes as last time, close my eyes, and wait for that time to come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D82)
I hear the sparse sound of applause from the event hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D92)
Meaning I should be hearing footsteps soon--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA0)
And, just as I thought, I see Kurisu with the same timing as when I waited last time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
Leaning against the wall, she checks the contents of the envelope and faintly smiles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F00)
Now I understand why Kurisu is smiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9E)
The Upa inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAE)
She's probably smiling at how adorable it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBE)
It really doesn't suit you, Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCE)
I smile bitterly inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDE)
My heart is calm even though I've already reached this point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEE)
Nakabachi's appearance is my signal to start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFE)
When he takes out his knife, I'll throw out the Cyalume Saber.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100E)
Then I scare Nakabachi away and stun Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101E)
I can do both by brandishing the stun gun I prepared beforehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102E)
That was my plan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001142)
The next set of footsteps resounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001152)
Kurisu raises her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001162)
I can't confirm it, but it's no doubt Nakabachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001206)
【Kurisu】...I have something to talk about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
【Nakabachi】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001226)
【Kurisu】Are you listening? Papa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001236)
Every single word Kurisu mutters is the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
【Nakabachi】What's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000126A)
【Kurisu】Papa, I heard you were going to hold a time machine presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127A)
【Kurisu】So I thought about it too. About whether or not a time machine could be made.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001318)
A disquieting air drifts between the two of them. Nakabachi doesn't even try to hide his displeasure at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001328)
Without a doubt, that's partly because of the complaint the first me rose during the presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001338)
It's just about time for Nakabachi to lose his temper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001348)
Once again, I check the Cyalume Saber in my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001358)
The glow has already dimmed. If I remove the cap at the tip, the fake blood will flow--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BC)
【Rintaro】...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145A)
I almost stop breathing unintentionally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A2)
I bring the dim Cyalume Saber to my eyes to check in detail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
The fake blood inside had begun to harden.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
Strange. This shouldn't be happening. I was certain it should keep fluid for at least 30 minutes after the light goes out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D2)
A dud!? Defective!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E2)
That reminds me, we haven't actually used the Cyalume Saber even once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F2)
The chemicals inside are single use, so it's a consumable item. Considering the lab's financial condition, we never used it, thinking it would be a waste.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150E)
It's such a disgrace to notice now of all times!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151E)
And I didn't even bring a spare.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152E)
Guh. Not as planned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153E)
The simulated scene in my head crumbles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164A)
【Nakabachi】I wasn't exiled!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165A)
I'm startled at Nakabachi's angry yell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
【Nakabachi】Those incompetent colleagues of mine were just jealous of my superiority. They were disgusted of me and just gave up on me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001684)
【Kurisu】Please don't yell...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001722)
Time won't stop for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001732)
How do I recover from the situation now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001742)
It's impossible to leave this place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001752)
In just a short while, Nakabachi will attack his own daughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001762)
If I come out after that, the result will just be the same as last time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
I'll end up killing Kurisu again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
That must be avoided at all costs...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
But then, just what should I do!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
Go back to the time machine and start again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B2)
No, that's no good. Suzuha already told me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
There's not enough fuel to leap through time again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D2)
This is my last chance!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001840)
【Kurisu】Hey. It's been so long since we last met, so there's a lot I want to talk about, but Papa, you're living in Aomori now, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185A)
【Nakabachi】Go back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001874)
【Kurisu】Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001884)
【Nakabachi】Just go back to America already. I don't want to see your face again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001894)
【Kurisu】But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AE)
【Nakabachi】What do you mean you want to hear my opinion!? What do you mean joint signatures! That isn't what you think in the slightest, is it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194C)
I don't know if it's because I'm in a rush, but sweat won't stop running down my brow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195C)
My heart keeps beating like it does after exercise, and my breathing gets rough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196C)
I cover my mouth with my hand to supress the sound of my breathing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D0)
【Nakabachi】Are you pitying me!? Do you despise me!? Even though you're my daughter!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EA)
【Kurisu】Wh-what are you talking about? Calm down--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019FA)
【Nakabachi】I'm perfectly calm! Don't tell me what to do!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A98)
Nakabachi won't stop heating up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA8)
The same words. The same development.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB8)
Heading straight towards tragedy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC8)
Time, please stop...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD8)
I beg but quickly stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE8)
Are you gonna rely on god, Hououin Kyouma?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF8)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B08)
Did you forget?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6C)
【Nakabachi】I'll tell you why I called you here today. I triumphed! I was going to flaunt the greatness of my research!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7C)
【Nakabachi】I going to show you just how despairingly far apart we are!

<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C6E)
【Kurisu】I didn't laugh at--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C88)
【Nakabachi】Do you want my opinion on this thesis? I'll tell you right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
【Nakabachi】I will publish this thesis with my name. That is all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA8)
Forget about the cruel god, forget about the will of the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB8)
I will save Kurisu myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC8)
I won't let her get killed again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD8)
I won't kill Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF2)
【Kurisu】...Papa, don't tell me... you're stealing it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D0C)
【Nakabachi】...What did you say?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1C)
【Kurisu】You're stealing... my thesis? That was the last thing I thought you'd do--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF0)
【Kurisu】--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F0A)
Kurisu's cheek is struck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F1A)
【Nakabachi】Who do you think you're talking to!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F2A)
It's finally started...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002224)
Nakabachi puts his hand to Kurisu's neck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002234)
Kurisu's groans of agony reach my ears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002244)
There's still a way to prevent Kurisu's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
The puddle of blood I once saw spreading underneath Kurisu's collapsed face down body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002264)
There's still one more way to reproduce that besides using fake blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002274)
That's--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002284)
A bet, to use the world's convergence against itself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002294)
But I don't know the odds of winning this bet, and arriving at the unknown world line, the Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022A4)
【Kurisu】Ah, uuh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B4)
【Nakabachi】You think you understand how I feel!? Why do you think you're so superior!? I detest you...! I hate your very existence!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C4)
【Nakabachi】Nobody in this world is superior to me! Understand!? It's a disgrace! There's no reason for a daughter to be superior to her father!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D4)
【Nakabachi】So I stayed away from you! I couldn't stand the thought of you being my daughter!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E4)
【Nakabachi】Because of you... because of you...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F4)
No--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002304)
Say no more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002314)
I am a mad scientist surpassing god.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002324)
What I desire is chaos.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002334)
I don't need any predetermined future...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002344)
【Rintaro】Stop!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002354)
I slowly step forward from my covering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242E)
Nakabachi turns to my direction, stunned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243E)
Glimmering, bloodshot eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244E)
【Nakabachi】You're... the one from before...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A0)
【Nakabachi】Because of you... my presentation was a failure!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B0)
Nakabachi's hand separates from Kurisu's neck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000250E)
【Kurisu】Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002538)
【Nakabachi】How dare you show your face to me again...! You... all of you are just getting in my way...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002548)
【Nakabachi】You're in cohoots with Kurisu aren't you!? That's it, that's it isn't it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002558)
【Nakabachi】I won't... let you brats... have your way...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002568)
Nakabachi takes the knife out of his pocket with bloodshot eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002578)
A blade reflecting cold light. Seeing that, I laugh provocatively.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002588)
【Rintaro】Just try it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002598)
【Nakabachi】Youngster... what are you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025A8)
【Rintaro】My name is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025B8)
【Rintaro】Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D2)
【Nakabachi】What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E2)
【Rintaro】If you don't know, then memorize it. Ho-oh as in phoenix, In, the temple. Finally, the Kyou in atrocious becomes Ma in truth. Hououin Kyouma...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F2)
【Rintaro】I am the one who desires chaos. The one who destroys the order in the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002602)
【Rintaro】And finally, the one who will crush your ambition!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026BE)
Kurisu gets up on wobbling legs while holding her neck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026CE)
【Kurisu】Run away...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026DE)
【Rintaro】I refuse!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027A4)
I turn to Nakabachi with both arms spread, not even looking at Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027B4)
【Rintaro】What's wrong, Doctor Nakabachi? Can't walk the walk? Not going to kill me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CE)
【Rintaro】But then again, killing someone with such divine strength as mine is probably impossible for the likes of you, huh!? Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000287C)
【Nakabachi】D-don't you mess with me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028CC)
Nakabachi goes into a frenzy. He points his blade and rushes forward.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028DC)
【Kurisu】No... Papa, stop it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028EC)
At this rate, the one who will get stabbed to death is me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FC)
Nakabachi's expression is no longer normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290C)
He's fallen into insanity. He's being controlled by his warped heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291C)
He can't be stopped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292C)
In that case, that impulse--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000293C)
I'll take it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000294C)
【Rintaro】You can't kill me! Absolutely not!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000295C)
【Nakabachi】Diee!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A1A)
The knife's sharp tip approaches before my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A2A)
Without removing my eyes from it,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A3A)
--I'll take it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B50)
【Rintaro】Gah... ha...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B6A)
【Nakabachi】Ha, haheehee, haheeheeheeheehee...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B86)
An intense pain pierces my abdomen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B96)
I feel the hard, cold blade pierce my body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BA6)
I was stabbed...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BB6)
I was stabbed... by that... knife...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC6)
Pain runs through my entire body like my guts were being stirred--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BD6)
【Rintaro】Ah, gaah, aaahh!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C5A)
The knife is pulled out, and a large amount of blood spills out of the wound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C6A)
【Rintaro】Haah, haah, gaha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C7A)
The taste of blood spreads through my mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C8A)
I'm about to lose consciousness from all the pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C9A)
My body's hot like it's burning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CAA)
My vision blurs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CBA)
I'm about to tumble down on the spot, but desperately endure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D0A)
【Nakabachi】L-look at you now... aheeheeheehee... that's what you get for ridiculing me--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D98)
【Nakabachi】Hee...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DA8)
I take out the stun gun, and for show, activate the electric arc, causing Nakabachi to go pale.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DB8)
【Rintaro】You've...done it now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DC8)
I glare at him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DD8)
I advance one step, and start feeling the urge to vomit from the back of my throat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DE8)
【Rintaro】Gach...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E6C)
Blood spews from my throat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E7C)
But I still don't let Nakabachi out of my sight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E8C)
【Rintaro】You've done it... you've really done it now...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E9C)

<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EAC)
【Nakabachi】Heeee...!

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EBC)
【Rintaro】You too, little girlie... I'll massacre everyone...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ECC)
【Kurisu】Don't move!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F88)
Kurisu rushes over to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F98)
She clings to my body, supporting it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FA8)
【Kurisu】Lie down! I'll call an ambulance right now...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000307A)
I just said massacre everyone so why is this woman running towards me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000308A)
She's good-natured even though she's a tsundere. Back when I was trying to save Mayuri, she was always the one who would support me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000309A)
【Rintaro】I'll... save you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030B4)
【Kurisu】Eh? What do--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003248)
【Kurisu】----
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003258)
Kurisu's body convulses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003268)
Strength leaves the legs that had supported me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003278)
She collapses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033CA)
I'm sorry for doing this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033DA)
I apologize in my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003488)
【Rintaro】I'll... torture your daughter as I please... after I kill you...

#WRITE(PTR, $00003498)
【Rintaro】Nakabachi... first... is you...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034A8)
【Rintaro】Heh, heh, heh hahahaha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034B8)
【Nakabachi】Hiiiii!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000356A)
And then Nakabachi throws away his knife with a pitiful cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000357A)
He retreats back one step. Two steps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003604)
【Nakabachi】Hyeehhhhhh!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003614)
For the finishing touch, I push the switch on the stun gun once more, and finally, Nakabachi turns away. He runs towards the elevator deep in the passage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003624)
But he makes sure to pick up the envelope Kurisu dropped. The shrewd man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003634)
【Rintaro】Haah... haah... haah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003644)
I try touching my stomach wound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C8)
【Rintaro】Ugg...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D8)
Just with that, pain penetrates my whole body, and I fall on my knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E8)
My consciousnesss is flying away from the pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F8)
The blood won't stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003708)
It keeps dripping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003718)
I kneel, and place both hands on the ground.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003728)
【Rintaro】Still not enough...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003738)
I stick my own fingers into my wound wet with blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003748)
I take a small breath and just take the plunge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003758)
【Rintaro】--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003768)
A terrible pain runs through it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003778)
I can't bear it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037D2)
【Rintaro】AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH----!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037E2)
I scream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000386C)
I'm seriously going to faint...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000387C)
But I still keep opening my wound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F2)
【Rintaro】Gahch, haah, haah, gguh, kha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003902)
The ground is stained more and more red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E6)
【Suzuha】Uncle Okarin!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A02)
Suzuha rushes here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A4A)
【Suzuha】Th-that wound...! What happened!? Just what happened!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A64)
【Suzuha】Dummy, of all things... to fail...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A74)
【Rintaro】Heh, hehe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8E)
【Suzuha】Uncle...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A9E)
【Rintaro】What are you misunderstanding, Suzuha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AAE)
【Rintaro】Look at this floor... notice anything...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ABE)
【Suzuha】Floor...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ACE)
【Rintaro】Heh, heh... that's plenty of blood... don't you think?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ADE)
The thing I made there. It's--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AF8)
【Suzuha】Ah...! A puddle of blood...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B08)
For the sake of deceiving the first me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B18)
For the sake of deceiving the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B28)
The stage is set...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B42)
【Suzuha】But at this rate, you'll die, Uncle...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B52)
【Rintaro】Kuku, there's no way I'm going to die...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B62)
【Rintaro】Who the hell do you think I am?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B72)
【Rintaro】I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, you know...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B82)
【Suzuha】Uncle...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B92)
I was stabbed in Kurisu's place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BA2)
I made a puddle of blood on the floor with my blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BB2)
If the world converges, then it's already predetermined that I won't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BC2)
The world desires not my death. My death is in 2025. That's fixed in this β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BD2)
That's my wager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BE2)
I dared to provoke Nakabachi, and got stabbed on purpose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF2)
I didn't think it would hurt this much though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C02)
If we reach the Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C12)
That's an unknown world line, with a completely undetermined future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C22)
Of course, that includes the part where I won't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C32)
How ironic. Even though it means I could die, I want to reach that world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C42)
My lips silently warp into a smile, and I complete the finishing touches.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C52)
【Rintaro】Suzuha... get Kurisu's body...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C6C)
【Suzuha】Ah, okay...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C88)
Suzuha lifts up Kurisu's body, which had fainted after one blast from the stun gun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C98)
Then she lays her face down on top of my puddle of blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D06)
Kurisu doesn't wake up. Unconscious, she stays perfectly still.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D16)
But she's definitely breathing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D84)
I gently stroke her hair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D94)
【Rintaro】Did it hurt...? I'm sorry. But I did it... to save you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DA4)
【Rintaro】Because... even though those three weeks... those days won't come back...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DB4)
【Rintaro】I wanted you to live...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DC4)
Even if we reach the Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD4)
Even if Kurisu lives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DE4)
Even if I don't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DF4)
We will probably never meet again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E04)
Kurisu will go to a future where she doesn't become a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E14)
A future where we don't make the Time Leap Machine together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E24)
But, I'm still glad I was able to save her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E92)
【Rintaro】...farewell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EA2)
Please stay unconscious here for a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EB2)
If you don't, then we can't deceive the first me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EC2)
I motion for Suzuha to pick up the knife, and I get up from blocking the wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ED2)
【Rintaro】Mission complete... Let's head back now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B4)
【Suzuha】Uncle, this is too absurd... There's a limit to foolishness!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C4)
【Rintaro】...foolishness, how rude. Everything went just as planned... hehheh... heh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D4)
【Suzuha】Don't talk. We'll return right now. To August 21.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040E4)
【Suzuha】Try to bear the G force okay? Ah, damn. We should at least do some first aid, but I didn't bring anything with me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040F4)
Pressure almost crushing my body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004104)
My wound throbs. I'm about to groan, but I bite my lip and bear it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042F6)
Rainbow lights fill my vision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004306)
The time machine seems to come alive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004316)
Suzuha wraps my wound with a towel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004326)
【Suzuha】Hey, Uncle. I'm sure that the Steins;Gate waits on the other side. A world unknown to me, you, or anyone waits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004336)
【Suzuha】You live, and Makise Kurisu lives, and Shiina Mayuri lives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004346)
【Suzuha】I don't time travel to 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004356)
【Suzuha】Though I don't know if World War III breaks out or not in this world line...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004366)
【Suzuha】Though I don't know if SERN's dystopia is constructed or not in this world line...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004376)
Someone's warm hand holds mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004386)
Tightly. Tightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004396)
【Suzuha】The world we believed in, where the future is filled with hope, is waiting...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044A0)
I softly close my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044B0)
Breathing is painful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044C0)
My pain slowly goes away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004524)
【Suzuha】Once we reach there, I'll most likely disappear. I won't be able to thank you for our arrival at the "Steins;Gate".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004534)
【Suzuha】So I'll thank you here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004544)
The feeling of her grasping hand gradually fades.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000460A)
【Suzuha】Thank you, Uncle. ...Don't die. Live.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000461A)
