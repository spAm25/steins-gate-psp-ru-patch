"MayQueen+Nyan⑯" is only a 3 minute walk away from the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001F8)
It can be found by going along the Kuramaebashi street and turning left at the Tsumakoisaka crossing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000208)
That's where I'm heading right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000218)
Because it's currently summer holidays, and due to the event at the Radio Building, Akiba is very active right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000228)
This area was blocked off by the police yesterday, but today I don't see a single officer here. Looks like they couldn't keep the Central Street blockaded for 2 days in a row...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000288)
The Radio Center, however, is still off limits... The entrances are closed by shutters and it's surrounded by the yellow tape that the police use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000298)
【Reporter】Were here in Akihabara, the day after the crash of the mysterious satellite-like object. There's a very large number of people gathered around the prohibited area.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A8)
【Reporter】The object cannot be removed until the people who are doing the investigation find out details about it, like what country it belongs to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B8)
【Reporter】The police states that there's no danger of the object exploding, but regardless of that, the locals and the visiting shoppers alike are uneasy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C8)
Obviously, the media is all over the place, with tens of cameras set up in front of the tape.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D8)
Besides them, there are also rubbernecks looking at either the satellite thing or their phones. So many of them that they pretty much cover the whole road.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E8)
This is quite a large amount of people...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F8)
I, a person living in Akiba, can tell that this riot is something beyond the usual festival.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000034C)
I wonder when that satellite is gonna be removed from the building...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000035C)
It's not gonna explode, is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000036C)
Since this area is not off limits anymore, I'm guessing that the thing is not dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000037C)
Or maybe they're just not warning people to prevent mass panic...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000038C)
Today, the otaku are exploring Akiba, looking for ero doujinshi, limited edition games or some computer parts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000039C)
Excluding the front of the Radio Center, this is pretty much the usual Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003AC)
A truly peaceful area.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BC)
That aside... Just what were the events I saw yesterday?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CC)
I should probably get a medical check up or something...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DC)
It could be that I have finally turned into those who can't tell what's real and what's not--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EC)
While thinking that, I look in front of me--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000440)
With a serious look on her face, a woman stands there, her cellphone raised to eye-level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B6)
【Rintaro】...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C6)
She took a photo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D6)
The lens was obviously aimed at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E6)
I quickly try to cover up my face with my hand, but I am too late.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000053E)
Just to make sure, I turn my head to check if she's someone I know, but she doesn't resemble anyone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E0)
【Moeka?】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F0)
Without even looking at me, she's checking the screen of her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060C)
Then, she turns her back towards me, raises the cellphone to eye-level again and aims the camera lens at another pedestrian.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000061C)
Could it be that she's doing this indiscriminately?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000062C)
Even if that's how it is, I still have to say something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000063C)
I, who is chased by the Organization, cannot allow data such as my portraits to leak into the wrong hands!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000064C)
The world is a dangerous place. I don't want to be blamed for something that I didn't do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065C)
【Rintaro】Wait, wait, wait!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A4)
【Moeka2】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B4)
She doesn't turn around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C4)
Is she so lost in photography that my voice doesn't even reach her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D4)
Or did she not understand my magnificent native-level English?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E4)
【Rintaro】Hey! You, using the phone camera! Wait! Please, wait!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FE)
【Moeka2】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070E)
After finally noticing me, she turns around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071E)
And just like before, she is aiming the lens of the cellphone at me--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000794)
【Rintaro】S-stop! No photos! Are you with the Organization or something!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007AE)
【Moeka3】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007BE)
She completely ignores my objection...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007CE)
...And looks at the screen of the cellphone again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007DE)
【Rintaro】I want you to answer me this. Are you a person of the Organization?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EE)
If she is, I'm gonna have to take a suitable method of dealing with her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007FE)
Don't think that I'll go down without a fight...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000818)
【Moeka4】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000828)
【Rintaro】A-am I mistaken?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000838)
【Moeka5】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000848)
【Rintaro】Even if I am, I must inform you that if the Organization finds out about you having photos of me, then their evil hand will reach you, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000858)
【Rintaro】Therefore, I want you to immediately delete the photos that you just took.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000868)
【Moeka6】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000878)
I-is she listening to me...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000892)
【Moeka6】...I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A2)
And so, the woman talks with a small voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B2)
【Moeka7】I made you feel, unpleasant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C2)
Then, she slightly lowers her chin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D2)
I can't tell if she's bowing her head or not, since she's always looking downwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E2)
【Rintaro】Before you apologize, I want you to delete the photos.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008FC)
【Moeka8】I took photos, of the scenery.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090C)
With impressive speed, the woman is pressing the buttons of her cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091C)
That action is in complete contrast with her irritating way of speaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092C)
【Rintaro】Taking photos of the scenery? Are you a tourist?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093C)
Or is she just another rubberneck who came to check out the satellite?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000094C)
If she is, then why is she taking pictures of me, and not the thing itself?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000095C)
While looking down, she shakes her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000096C)
【Moeka9】...Proof. Of where I was, walking today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000097C)
【Rintaro】What a weird person...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000996)
【MoekaA】Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A6)
【Rintaro】Hm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B6)
【Moeka】Name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C6)
Looks like she just introduced herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D6)
I don't really care about it, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
I just want her to delete the photos.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
【Moeka】I have something, to ask... Can I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A06)
【Rintaro】Before that, the photos--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A16)
【Moeka】About an urban legend... of Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A26)
【Moeka】...Do you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A36)
Akihabara's urban legends?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A46)
What is she talking about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE4)
Could it be that there are rumors about a fearful genius mad scientist?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF4)
Could it be that he has a bounty on his head, and that many assassins are searching for him with bloodshot eyes...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B04)
【Rintaro】Kuh... I... Have stayed here for too long...! But, it looks like it's about time...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B14)
When I think back upon Akihabara, it's not a bad town.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B24)
That's probably why I overstayed here...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B34)
【Moeka】The phantom, retro PC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B98)
【Rintaro】Retro PC?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA8)
The woman answers that question with what looks like a light nod.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB8)
【Moeka】Apparently, it's somewhere in, Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC8)
【Rintaro】R-really...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD8)
So it wasn't about the mad scientist and all that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE8)
I feel both disappointment and relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF8)
Still, an urban legend about a phantom retro PC in Akihabara, eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C08)
This is the first I ever heard of it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C20)
【Rintaro】By "retro PC", do you mean the <DICT>98</DICT>?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C30)
I speak the first idea that came to mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C40)
But, does 98 really go into the "phantom retro PC" area?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C50)
The woman slightly shakes her head to the sides... At least, that's what it looks like.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6A)
【Moeka】...No. This.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7A)
Saying that, she shows me the LCD screen of the phone that she's been holding all this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
The display is showing a picture of a weirdly shaped computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDC)
It's hard to tell due to the monochrome, but it does look like a PC...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEC)
Even if it isn't shaped like the latest generation of PCs, I can tell that much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFC)
I think I've seen this one somewhere...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
【Moeka】"IBN 5100".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
IBN 5100...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2C)
【Rintaro】The one that John Titor tried to get, eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D46)
I think I just saw the fingers that hold the phone twitch a little...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D62)
【Moeka】You seen it...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D72)
【Rintaro】No. I only know that name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D82)
This is quite a coincidence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D92)
Or, perhaps--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA2)
【Rintaro】This might be the choice of Steins;Gate...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBC)
【Moeka】Do you know... Well-informed people...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCC)
【Rintaro】Daru might know more about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE4)
【Rintaro】He's my broright hand man and a Super Haka who is capable of hacking the headquarters of <DICT>MI6</DICT>
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF4)
I'm over-dramatizing it with the MI6 thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E04)
If something like that happened, we would be taken away by people in black suits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E14)
But it's certain that he's a Super Haka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E24)
The depth of his knowledge of PCs is abnormal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E34)
Speaking of him, I was heading towards "MayQueen+Nyan⑯"... I shouldn't be wasting time here with an unknown woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4C)
【Rintaro】I will take my leave now. Try to keep the <DICT>Media Scrum</DICT> from running out of control, woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB6)
After saying that, I try to take my leave, but she grabs the edge of my clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101E)
【Rintaro】What are you doing!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102E)
【Moeka】Give me... The email.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103E)
【Rintaro】...What's your purpose?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104E)
【Moeka】Of the... Super Haka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
Apparently, she wants to talk with Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FC)
This is partially my fault for mentioning him in the first place...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000110C)
I'm going to Daru's location anyway, so I guess I can take her, as we-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111C)
...No, but wait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000112C)
There's the possibility that this is a trap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000113C)
She could be a spy who wants to steal the valuable war power that is Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000114C)
If I lose Daru, I will be defenseless...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000115C)
All I will have left on my team will be Mayuri the "Cosplay Maker(female only)".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C0)
【Rintaro】I refuse! Right now, I cannot lose Daru!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121C)
I quickly free myself from her, and start to walk away at a fast pace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000122C)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123C)
I throw a glance behind me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A0)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B0)
The woman is following.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130C)
I attempt to run away...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131C)
But she's still right behind me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001386)
【Rintaro】Stop following me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001396)
I turn around and complain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B0)
She, however, ignores my words and for some reason shows me the screen of her cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CA)
Displayed on there is the photo that she took recently, with my stupid expression on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013DA)
【Rintaro】Geh! You didn't delete it yet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EA)
【Moeka】If you tell me... I'll delete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FA)
【Rintaro】Blackmail, huh...? Just what the hell are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140A)
Displaying my true nature, I intensively glare at her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141A)
However, that doesn't have any effect on her, since she is looking downwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001434)
【Moeka】I am...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001444)
She hesitates for a moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001454)
【Moeka】A part-time worker, at "Arc Rewrite"...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001464)
【Rintaro】The hell is that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147C)
【Moeka】<DICT>An editing company</DICT>... It's in, Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000148C)
She's a part-timer in an editing company?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000149C)
This mumbling and gloomy woman doesn't look like she's right for the job.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014AC)
【Rintaro】Huh! You're planning to use my photo for an article!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C6)
The portrait of a mad scientist hiding in Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D6)
If the Organization gets their hands on this, then they will approach my hideout-lab and turn Akiba into a sea of blood--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
Damn it, I must avoid that outcome.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F6)
Well, I guess it can't be helped...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001506)
【Rintaro】Let's negotiate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001516)
If a part-time worker of an editing company has that photo, it might be used for something that I would not approve of.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001536)
I enter my email address into my cellphone, and show it to the woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001586)
Alternating her view between my and her own cellphones, she copies it at an amazing speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001596)
That quickness is not something I could mimic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A6)
【Rintaro】Oh, so this woman... is a superhuman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B6)
I'll call her ability, "Shining Finger".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C6)
If she can input an email of 255 cursed letters in 1 minute, the recipient will die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001616)
She finishes copying the email address in only about 5 seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001636)
【Moeka】Name...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001646)
【Rintaro】Hououin Kyouma. A mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001656)
【Moeka】How... Is it spelled?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001666)
【Rintaro】Ho-oh as in phoenix, In, the temple. Finally, the Kyou in atrocious becomes Ma in truth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001680)
【Moeka】......Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001690)
【Rintaro】It's Ho-oh as in phoenix, In, the temple. Finally, the Kyou in atrocious becomes Ma in truth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A0)
I repeat my explanation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B0)
It's the origin of my true name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C0)
Explaining "in" would take too long, so I just left it at that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016DA)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016EA)
Looking kinda puzzled, the woman adds my name to her address list.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173A)
【Moeka】Like this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
【Rintaro】What? Don't mess around with me! Are you making fun of my true name!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179E)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AE)
The woman lightly faces downwards. Apparently, she's bowing her head in apology.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BE)
【Rintaro】Then, give me that cellphone! I will type it in correctly!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D8)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001828)
The woman reacts to that by shaking her head and grabbing her cellphone with both of her hands, as if to protect it from me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001838)
She's acting like a spoiled brat who can't let go of a toy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001848)
Apparently, she doesn't want to give it to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001858)
The extent to which she dislikes the idea makes me feel rejected as a person.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)
That makes me feel a bit down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001878)
Well, looks like I'll have to get her email address and send her a blank mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001922)
She already told me her name, but I don't remember, so I decided to add her as "Shining Finger".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001940)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195E)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197C)
Crap. Why am I standing in the middle of the road and doing nothing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199A)
I'll just send her a blank mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019B8)
I don't see the need to type anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D6)
And there should be no harm in giving her my true name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F4)
I prepare a blank mail to the "Shining Finger" that I just added to my address list.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF8)
Aaand, send.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8A)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CAE)
Her cellphone doesn't react, and she's looking at me as if she wants to ask a question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CBE)
Why isn't my mail reaching her, is it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D98)
【Rintaro】Woah!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC0)
Suddenly, the ringtone comes out of my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DDE)
When I look at the screen, it says that the one calling me is Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F80)
【Rintaro】It's me. What is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F9C)
【Itaru】What do you mean, "what is it?"? Just how long do I have to wait? And what's with the blank mail just now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB8)
【Rintaro】The blank mail... Came to you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD4)
【Itaru】Yep, it did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FF0)
【Rintaro】That was a mistake. The mail will delete itself in 10 minutes, so don't worry about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200C)
【Itaru】Wait, wha-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002066)
I sent the mail to the wrong address.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002076)
That's why it didn't reach this woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002086)
Let's try this again...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002142)
I press the "don't answer" button to ignore the call from Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002152)
No matter how long she stands there, my blank mail doesn't seem to be reaching, so I guess I'll have to send another one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002222)
Aaand, send.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B4)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C4)
The woman is looking at her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D4)
Looks like it's really difficult for her to look people in the eyes...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234A)
After a time lag of a few seconds, the woman received a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000235A)
【Moeka】...Okabe... Rintaro?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000236A)
【Rintaro】Wha-!? How do you know that name!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002384)
【Moeka】It's in this mail...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002394)
Crap, my emails come with my real name...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023A4)
I must fix this mistake!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B4)
【Rintaro】That's an alias I use to trick the world. I'll send another mail with Hououin Kyouma on it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023CE)
【Moeka】It's fine... Like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023DE)
【Rintaro】What are you saying!? I am not Okabe Rintaro, but Hououin Kyoum--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023EE)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023FE)
She's completely ignoring me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000240E)
【Rintaro】Did you erase the photos?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000241E)
The woman slightly nods... Or so it looks like.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242E)
Just like always, I can't really tell if she's nodding or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243E)
【Rintaro】If you did, then show me some proof.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002490)
Wordlessly, she shows me the screen of her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A0)
The only picture in her storage is the photo of the PC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B0)
What a relief...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D6)
【Moeka】...I'll send you, a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E6)
【Moeka】Listen about it... Okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F6)
【Rintaro】About what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002506)
【Moeka】...Urban Legend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002516)
Oh, that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002526)
We talked about it just now, didn't we...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002542)
The "Shining Finger" leaves the location without any signs of satisfaction with the exchange and no proper goodbyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002552)
A woman who's always calm and collected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002562)
I don't think we had any eye contact at all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002632)
Aaand, send.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C4)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E8)
Her cellphone doesn't react, and she's looking at me as if she wants to ask a question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F8)
Why isn't it arriving?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002708)
We look at each others phone screens, slightly disturbed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000277A)
It's annoying, but I guess I'll have to send another one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002910)
Aaand, send.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002998)
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029BC)
Her cellphone doesn't react, and she's looking at me as if she wants to ask a question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029CC)
Why isn't it arriving?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029DC)
We look at each others phone screens, slightly disturbed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A4E)
It's annoying, but I guess I'll have to send another one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C94)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA4)
The woman scowls while looking at her cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CC8)
Then, she throws me a glance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD8)
I feel as if her eyes just said "Hurry up and send it".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE8)
I'm kinda hesitating here...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF8)
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to give her my true name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D08)
But regardless of how long I hesitate, I don't think that she will let me go until I send her the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D18)
Man, she's good at this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D7C)
Looks like I have no choice but to send the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E10)
After that, we exchanged a few words, and she ran off somewhere.
