Afterwards, I see several black shadows break into the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9C)
With movements all too quick.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAC)
With sharpness all too trained.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBC)
And with pointed guns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
Nobody in the lab, including me, had time to so much as scream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDC)
About five men had broken in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEC)
I don't recognize a single one of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFC)
They're dressed in showy shirts and shorts, polo shorts and jeans. A casual appearance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
But the arms sticking out of the short sleeves are awfully thick.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
Furthermore, their sharp glares are enough to make you shiver.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2C)
The men are holding guns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3C)
And not just handguns. Several of them have automatic rifles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4C)
AK-47s in Akiba, the heart of Tokyo?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5C)
What kind of joke is this...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6C)
The only thing certain is that these guys aren't your average shoppers or tourists.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7C)
【Rounder A】Don't move. Everyone, hands in the air.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8C)
Among the sudden intruders, a dark skinned crew-cut man lets out a crushing voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9C)
Like a dream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAC)
Or a movie scene?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBC)
This is the first time so many people have gathered in this room since I started renting it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCC)
It feels awfully narrow. I thought that out of place thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDC)
The first to raise his hands is Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEC)
Then Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFC)
And then me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0C)
Mayuri.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1C)
Silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2C)
Standstill.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3C)
The intruders say no more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4C)
The men hold their guns at ready.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E5C)
Their muzzles pointed towards us with our hands up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E6C)
A comic's laughing voice flows from the TV.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8C)

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9C)
I think that optimistic thought.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB2)
Now I hear a new sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC2)
Beyond the door kicked open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED2)
This is the sound of heels.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE2)
A woman is coming up the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF2)
Are the intruders waiting for that woman?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F02)
Is she the commander of these strong men or something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F12)
The attack force, and their female commander. It's almost like a manga.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F22)
Reality fades.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F32)
Eventually, the heel woman appears.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F68)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F78)
【Rintaro】Kiryuu... Moeka...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F88)
The editorial part timer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
The mail demon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA8)
The dark woman who always glares at her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB8)
Lab Member 005.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC8)
That Moeka... is the leader of the intruders?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD8)
This woman... without any ambition?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE8)
This woman... who always looks down instead of directly at my face, even now?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF8)
--This is bullshit.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001008)
【Mayuri】Moeka-san? This is...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001018)
【Moeka】We're taking the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001028)
While hearing her usual subdued speech,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001038)
Which is completely unfitting,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001048)
I almost feel like laughing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001058)
But I don't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001068)
My heart's bouncing too damn loudly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001078)
The inside of my mouth is dry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001088)
Even if it's bullshit, I can't laugh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001098)
I'm immobile, with my hands in the air.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A8)
【Moeka】Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B8)
I don't understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C8)
What the hell is this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D8)
Why is it Kiryuu Moeka?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E8)
I don't know, so I have to ask.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F8)
【Rintaro】What is the meaning of this...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001108)
【Moeka】I won't answer that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001118)
【Rintaro】This is a joke... right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001128)
Moeka shakes her head at my question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001138)
【Moeka】There's no need to tell you all, is what I mean.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001148)
【Moeka】No resistance permitted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001158)
【Moeka】Anyway, come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001168)
【Rintaro】W-where to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001178)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001188)
No words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001198)
Meaning she doesn't intend to answer that either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A8)
Dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B8)
These guys are dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C8)
You can tell they're not normal by how they have guns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D8)
I know we'll get in serious trouble if we come with these guys.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E8)
I try to refuse, but my voice is hoarse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F8)
I unconsciously look at these guys' guns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001208)
Those are real, aren't they....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001218)
They won't suddenly start shooting, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001228)
【Rintaro】U-unless you tell me the reason and destination, I can't come with you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001238)
【Moeka】Resistance is futile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001248)
【Moeka】You have nowhere to run.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001258)
【Moeka】My comrades are already spread throughout Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
No way--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001278)
My disquieting imagination sparks in my head like an electric shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001288)
No way, it was these guys who stopped the trains with the bomb threat...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001298)
For what purpose?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A8)
So we can't run away?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B8)
Just for that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C8)
【Moeka】I don't want to resort to violence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D8)
【Moeka】The three of you, come with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E8)
【Kurisu】Why--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F8)
Kurisu, who had kept silent until now, finally opened her mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001308)
【Kurisu】three?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001318)
That's when I first noticed that she hadn't included Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001328)
【Moeka】I have no intention of answering any questions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001338)
【Moeka】All you people have to do is come with me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001348)
The conversation's flowing in parallel lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001358)
The standoff continues.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001368)
【Itaru】O-Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001378)
Daru whispers to me while wavering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001388)
His face is visibly pale.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001398)
【Itaru】F-for now, don't you think, we should do as she says...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A8)
【Rintaro】But unless she tells me her goal...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B8)
Honestly, I have no idea what to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C8)
My heart's still fluttering. This seems more like a dream than reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D8)
Reality has already left this room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F0)
I'm not a <DICT>mili-ota</DICT>, so I haven't seen real guns before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001400)
If I had to say, the black luster of these guys' guns feels more cheap than dignified.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001410)
If you told me they were model guns, I'd agree.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001420)
【Mayuri】H-hey, Moeka-san, you're a fellow lab mem... aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001430)
Moeka certainly was a strange woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001440)
But I welcomed her as a lab mem fully aware of that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001450)
What does Moeka think?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001460)
Mayuri's question almost asks for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156C)
Moeka answers that question--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163A)
By pulling a gun out of her shirt and readying it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164A)
Which reminds me, today, Moeka isn't gripping that purple phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165A)
I thought she had an unhealthy dependence on her phone and wouldn't ever let go of it, so this was unexpected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
Not like noticing that matters now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167A)
Moeka's gun hand shakes pitifully.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168A)
Is she tense in this situation too?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169A)
Of course. By nature, Moeka's not good at talking with people face to face--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AA)
【Moeka】-The reason we're having you come with us--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
【Moeka】Is to silence you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CA)
Silence us...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016DA)
【Moeka】That won't change even if you refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016EA)
Basically, she means to kill us...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016FA)
What the hell's with that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170A)
【Rintaro】By whose orders...? Who are you people...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171A)
【Moeka】We are--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172A)
Moeka suddenly lifts her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173A)
That Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174A)
Looks straight at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175A)
Her cloudy eyes which seem daunting to me. Her emotionless voice whispers--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176A)
【Moeka】From SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001786)
SERN!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
【Rounder A】M4
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B2)

<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D2)

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E2)
Heeding him, Moeka hangs her head again.

【Moeka】If you refuse any more, we'll make you want to come with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A06)
Moeka slowly raises her gun hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A16)
She points its muzzle to--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B16)
【Mayuri】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B26)
Mayuri.
<END>

【Rintaro】Stop!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD4)
I try lunging at Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE4)
But as soon as I take a step, the dark-skinned crew-cut man draws close faster than me--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D46)
【Rintaro】Gagh--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D56)
A strong impact to my chin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D66)
That shock spreads throughout my whole body--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D76)
And carries away.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
My body staggers.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E06)
When I lift my face.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E64)
Mayuri reaches out her hand to me in tears.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F38)
Then, over Mayuri's shoulder, I see Moeka ready her gun.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000204A)

<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000205A)

#WRITE(PTR, $0000206A)
I try to stop it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000207A)
But my hoarse voice won't come out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000208A)
I just looked stupid, spewing out air.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000209A)

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D0)
Warm liquid splashes onto my face.

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E0)
Mayuri's delicate, small body falls toward me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000261C)
I catch it.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000262C)
Mayuri's body was like a marionette with its strings cut.

Before Daru joined us,

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A9C)
Mayuri and I would spend hours in the lab lazing around, and then take the train all the way back to Ikebukuro.

All of the smiles Mayuri smiled spin round and round in my head.

Anger hatred hatred anger anger hatred anger anger anger hatred hatred anger hatred hatred anger I want to kill everything.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DC2)
I gently lay the motionless Mayuri to rest on the floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DD2)
I stand up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DE2)
I try to plop down and barrel roll to approach Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F5E)
Okabe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6E)
She grabs my arm from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F7E)
【Kurisu】You can't...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F8E)
【Rintaro】Let me go, let me go!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F9E)
【Kurisu】You can't, you can't... they'll kill you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FAE)
Moeka's gun is now pointed to my brow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FBE)
Her finger is already on the trigger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FCE)
【Rintaro】You gonna kill me too!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FDE)
【Moeka】If you resist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FEE)
【Kurisu】Okabe, please, for now, just obey... okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FFE)
【Kurisu】At this rate, they'll kill you too...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000300E)
I shake off Kurisu's shaking hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030DE)
My vision becomes a tunnel with Moeka on the other side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030EE)
I cannot forgive this woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003144)
Just like she mercilessly killed Mayuri,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000322C)
%CFF78FI will kill her--%CE
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000323C)
【Kurisu】Noo!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000324C)
I see a small shadow soar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000325C)
It strikes Moeka's gun hand--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003588)
【Moeka】...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035A4)
The sound of gunfire echoes before my eyes, stunning my ears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035B4)
Tremendous pain from my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035C4)
My feet shake again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035D4)
But I'm not dead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035E4)
Was I saved?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003686)
When I take a good look, Moeka had dropped her gun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003696)
At her feet, a small stone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036A6)
【Suzuha?】Get down!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C2)
【Rounder B】Gweh!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000372E)
Suzuha, appearing before I noticed her, knocked down one of the attackers standing close to the entryway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000373E)
And she plunges into yet another man's chest--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000375A)
She lunges forth with a sharp elbow strike.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000376A)
The attackers turn their guns towards her, but she hinders them by flinging the fainted man at them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003786)
She slides to the feet of the man at the rear, tripping him, and with smooth, flowing motions, she drives her knee into the man's face as he falls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A2)
【Rounder A】Why that...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037B2)
The remaining dark skinned crew cut guy tries to shoot his automatic rifle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037C2)
But before he can, Suzuha snatches a stunned attackers gun and shoots him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037DE)
【Rounder A】Gwah!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037EE)
Blood spurts out of the man's hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003810)
Without stopping, Suzuha delivers a soaring soccer ball kick to the squatting crew cut guy's jaw.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000382C)
【Moeka】That's enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F4)
【Suzuha】!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003904)
Moeka thrusts her gun at Suzuha's nose after she had instantly mowed down the five burly men.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003914)
Suzuha points her gun to Moeka's neck in response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003924)
A staredown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003934)
Silence returns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003944)
【Moeka】...who are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003954)
【Suzuha】42
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003964)
Suzuha murmurs a cryptic number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003974)
She glances at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003984)
【Suzuha】TV
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003994)
What's with her broken speech?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039A4)
【Suzuha】Turned on
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039B4)
【Moeka】What are...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039C4)
Next to me, Kurisu suddenly stands up and rushes into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039D4)
【Moeka】Don't move!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039F0)
【Suzuha】That's my line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A00)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A10)
I finally realize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A20)
The meaning of Suzuha's ambiguous words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A30)
42. TV. Turned on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A40)
She means the 42in Braun tube TV downstairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A50)
Basically--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A60)
Use the Time Leap Machine...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AB8)
I look towards Mayuri's corpse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AC8)
She's laying quietly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AD8)
Closed eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AE8)
 Never to open again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AF8)
One of the attackers Suzuha knocked out starts to moan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B08)
If the attackers wake up, it'll be impossible to move.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BA8)
Suzuha looks at me again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BB8)
Pleading eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BC8)
If I time leap, I can go back to before Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BD8)
But if I fail, my memories could very well be destroyed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BE8)
If I fail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF8)
What am I hesitating for?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C14)
Mayuri's dead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C24)
Killed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C34)
Like hell I can accept this absurd reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C44)
I'll change it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C54)
I'll change this reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C64)
If I have a way to change it, I'll use it...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C74)
I have a way to change it, so how could I not use it...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD6)
With staggering legs, I leap into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DE6)
Kurisu's about to put on the headgear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DF6)
I pull it away from her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E3E)
【Kurisu】Okabe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E4E)
【Rintaro】I'll leap...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E5E)
【Kurisu】No, I will--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E6E)
I grab Kurisu's wrist as she tries to take it back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E7E)
I stare at her wet eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E8E)
【Rintaro】I will save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E9E)
【Kurisu】But! If you fail--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EBA)
I ignore her and put on the headgear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ECA)
It looks like Moeka's last shot grazed my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EDA)
One of my ears is stunned and can't hear anything but ringing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EEA)
There's blood on my neck. But I don't mind it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EFA)
I might fail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F0A)
But I have to try.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F1A)
This is all I have to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F2A)
Kurisu bites her lip and starts setting up the X68000.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F3A)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro! One guy's moving!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F4A)
【Moeka】Kill them, don't let them use it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F5A)
【Rounder A】I won't...let you...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F6A)
The crew-cut man staggers into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000400C)
Right away, I take Future Gadget No.4: Monad Snake off the shelf.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000401C)
I push the switch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004082)
My vision turns white.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004092)
I can't see anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040A2)
I can't tell anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B2)
【Moeka】Kill them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040CE)
【Kurisu】Augh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040E4)
【Rintaro】Kurisu!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000412C)
【Kurisu】Ugh, gh, Okabe!! Is this really okay!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004146)
【Kurisu】Are you okay with time leaping!? Are you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004156)
【Rintaro】Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000440A)
【Rintaro】!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000441A)
Severe pain in my right arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000442A)
Was I shot?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000443A)
知るものか。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004628)
Like I give shit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004638)
After that, beyond the smoke. Bluish-white light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004648)
The discharge phenomenon is starting!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004658)
My feet shake intensively.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004668)
The ring singularity opens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046BC)
I push down the headgear with one hand and crouch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047E2)
Mayuri...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047F2)
I won't die...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004802)
I'll cross through time to save you...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004812)
So...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004822)
Wait for me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004878)
Tremendous shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004888)
Leap--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004898)
My memories--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048A8)
Leap, to the past--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048CA)
【Rintaro】Leaaaaaaaap!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048DA)
Right after I scream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048EA)
The world is blown away--
