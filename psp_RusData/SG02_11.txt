#WRITE(PTR, $00000892)
Whew, so rushed....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A2)
With this, we can't attack the parts shops any more today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B2)
I take a deep breath while looking around and find a strange silhouette.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C2)
A lone woman is squatting on the ground, hugging her knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D2)
In her hand is a gaudy purple phone. She's staring at its screen without moving a muscle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E2)
Since nobody else is around, she's even more conspicuous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F2)
And on further inspection, it's a face I remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F8)
【Rintaro】Shining Finger!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7E)
I try calling, but there's no reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8E)
I just christened her Shining Finger on my own, so I guess it's natural.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9E)
Umm, her name... her name was... Moe... Moekko? No... umm....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0C)
【Rintaro】Shining Finger!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1C)
I end up moving in front of her, but she still doesn't notice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2C)
Or rather, I called out right in front of her, yet she doesn't lift up her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3C)
Her fingers are restlessly typing on her phone, so she doesn't seem to be unconscious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4C)
But she still looks dead. There's no life in her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5C)
I'm actually worried since she's not sweating at all despite the heat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6C)
【Rintaro】Can you not hear me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7C)
【Moeka】...Who?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8C)
【Rintaro】Hououin Kyouma. The mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDE)
She looks at me for a moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEE)
But it was really only a moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFE)
【Moeka】...Who, again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0E)
【Rintaro】You, can you not remember people's faces?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1E)
I don't remember Shining Finger's name, so I'm not one to talk, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2E)
【Rintaro】Even though we agreed to help look for the IBN 5100, this is how it is, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3E)
Shining Finger twitches upon hearing the word IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4E)
But she still doesn't raise her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5E)
【Moeka】Okabe-kun...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6E)
【Rintaro】I am Hououin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C88)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C98)
Ignoring me? Will she not recognize me as Hououin Kyouma no matter what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3A)
【Moeka】Sent... mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D58)
【Rintaro】Mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D76)
I certainly did just receive a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDA)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEA)
I'm almost enraged.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFA)
Was that really something you should say by mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0A)
Wouldn't it only take 5 seconds to say it verbally!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1A)
She's courteous when mailing, but the Shining Finger in front of me is a lump of unsociability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2A)
How she writes Funny meeting you here♪ without smiling at all makes me think she's actually a different person.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F40)
【Rintaro】It truly is funny, huh. You looking through parts shops as well?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F50)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F60)
Even when I ask her a question, Shining Finger doesn't even respond--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001002)
Another mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D2)
【Rintaro】Can you not even speak?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E2)
【Moeka】...bother.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F2)
【Rintaro】Isn't it more of a bother to type out mail!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000120C)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121C)
Shining Finger starts hanging her head more and more after I yelled. She buries her face into her knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012BE)
Anyway, don't wear such a short skirt. If you sit like that, it's completely visible. Though, she doesn't seem to mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132C)
I sigh, and silently leave the place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133C)
I buy two Max Coffees from a nearby vending machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013DE)
She mails about every little thing....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001542)
I'm more amazed than angry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001552)
Besides, since I haven't come across anything, I need to get Moeka's IBN 5100 information, so I don't plan to go home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001562)
Come to think of it, this woman's name was Moeka, right? I remembered when I saw her mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001578)
Holding the two Max Coffees, I return to Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161C)
【Moeka】Ah, Okabe-kun...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162C)
Shining Finger was standing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163C)
She just glances at me and breathes a sigh of relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164C)
【Rintaro】Want one?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D8)
I hand out a Max Coffee, which Shining Finger timidly accepts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E8)
But she doesn't start on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F8)
I wait for the coffee to cool down, open the tab, and take a sip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001708)
I want to savor this sweetness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001718)
【Rintaro】Why don't you speak?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001728)
【Moeka】Because mailing... is easier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001738)
Like hell it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001748)
Maybe she just has anthropophobia.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001758)
With that in consideration, I'm taken aback by my own thoughtlessness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F6)
【Rintaro】I see, so that's what it is...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001806)
So basically, Shining Finger is afraid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001816)
Of my, insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma's, evil aura!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001826)
There's no helping it in that case. I nod to her behavior.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001836)
Rather, I feel sorry. She's pitiable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001846)
Anybody would be overwhelmed before me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AA)
【Moeka】I'm... weird, aren't I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BA)
【Rintaro】No, you're normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D4)
【Moeka】Really...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E4)
For no matter how disciplined your mind is, you will be subjugated with fear for me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F4)
【Rintaro】You have nothing to be ashamed about. In this world, there exists something called absolute eternal truth. It's a wall, unchangeable no matter how much you struggle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001904)
【Rintaro】Therefore, people give up, give in, and change course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001914)
【Rintaro】But never forget this one thing. You hold within your heart, your own Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192E)
【Moeka】Steins;Gate...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193E)
【Rintaro】All people inevitably hold one of that door. As long as you have it, you can follow any path without losing your way... That's right, just like I do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001958)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001968)
Moeka nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001978)
Looks like I got her to understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001988)
【Rintaro】So, this is the real question at hand. Do you have any information on the IBN 5100?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A2)
Moeka answers by faintly shaking her head side to side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019B2)
【Rintaro】Just how long have you been searching?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C2)
【Moeka】...About 2 months.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D2)
【Rintaro】How have you been searching?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EC)
Of course, Moeka starts moving her fingers at high speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD4)
2 months with four people....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE4)
Even though hordes of otaku come to Akiba each day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AFA)
【Rintaro】Have you tried talking to PC shop employees? They're got the most detailed PC information in Akiba, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0A)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B24)
Moeka shakes her head side to side again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B34)
I'm starting to feel she's no good at investigation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B44)
Like she's just wasting her time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B54)
That whatever write editorial company that ordered Shining Finger to investigate must be incompetent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B64)
She's trying to work part-time for an editorial company even though she's like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B74)
【Rintaro】So which one's your goal? To obtain the IBN 5100, or to investigate the urban legend?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B8E)
【Moeka】Both.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9E)
【Rintaro】I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAE)
In that case, her search is limited to IBN 5100s in Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBE)
To tell the truth, I don't care about the urban legend, but I just want to obtain the IBN 5100. My true goal comes after obtaining it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BCE)
So I don't need to fuss over just the IBN 5100s in Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BDE)
Meaning I have no problem ordering one from a foreign net auction. Though, that would take time and money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BEE)
If I don't find one after 2 or 3 days of searching, let's consider doing that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BFE)
【Rintaro】Where do you plan to search next?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C18)
【Moeka】That's...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C28)
【Moeka】I'm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C38)
【Rintaro】Hm? I didn't quite hear you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C52)
Moeka types out a mail at high speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE0)
No good. She's useless after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF6)
【Rintaro】Don't worry. I have that sort of networking. If I use it, finding a retro PC should be no trouble at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D10)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D20)
Moeka looks up for the first time today. That look was a look of respect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D30)
【Rintaro】Who do you think I am? I am Hououin Kyouma! What I wish for is the collapse of the ruling structures, and chaos! Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D40)
【Moeka】That's... Okabe-kun's Steins;Gate...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D50)
【Rintaro】Not Okabe, Hououin!
<FILEEND94>
