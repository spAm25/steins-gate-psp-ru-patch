Part of the audience had already started forming a line in front of UPX an hour and a half before opening.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001FC)
Since it's already the finals, I didn't think there would be many participants.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
But several casual players are participating in a general public tournament at the same time as, but unrelated to the finals.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000021C)
The participants gathering at the hall enter through a different entrance than the spectators.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000022C)
I'm at the participant entrance, waiting for Faris to make her appearance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000302)
After about 15 minutes, Faris appears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000312)
She lives right next door, with less than a three minute walk, so she has a pretty flexible schedule.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FA)
By the way, she's already in her cat ear equipment and MayQueen maid clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000049E)
It feels strange for her to wear that uniform even though that store doesn't exist in this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000054C)
Faris sees my face and opens her eyes wide in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F0)
【Faris】Kyouma, what are you doing here nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000694)
【Rintaro】I wanted to meet you so I waited here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000740)
【Faris】Hanya!?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075A)
 Y-you're not going to confess your love for meow? If you confess before such an important match, I'll be in trouble nya~n
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000802)
【Rintaro】Wh-why would I? Don't misunderstand. No way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B0)
【Faris】...Kyouma's not in the mood today nya. Usually you'd talk back more nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000954)
I have no time to be Hououin Kyouma now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F8)
【Faris】This decisive battle has me nervous, so I want to liven up nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9C)
She doesn't look nervous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B40)
【Rintaro】Just listen, Faris! This is important for your victory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEE)
【Faris】Important? But Kyouma, you don't know the RaiNet rules at all, do ya nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C92)
【Rintaro】No, it's not a problem with the rules.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D36)
【Faris】Then, what is it nya~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDA)
She looks into my face with suspicious eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E7E)
I better give her the stuff before I screw up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F22)
【Rintaro】Take these with you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC6)
I try handing over the sunglasses and earplugs I bought on the way here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106A)
But Faris draws her ands back as if on guard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001118)
【Faris】Kyouma... that's kinda gross nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BC)
How rude!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001260)
【Faris】Normally, for presents, you give more pleasing things--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001304)
【Rintaro】That's not it. These are your counter-interference measures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B2)
【Faris】Nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001456)
【Rintaro】Okay, listen. I came... from the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001504)
【Faris】I know nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A8)
【Rintaro】What...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164C)
She knows? What does that mean!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F0)
Why...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179E)
【Faris】By the way, Faris came from space nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001842)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E6)
I shouldn't forget I'm dealing with Faris Nyannyan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198A)
【Rintaro】This isn't a joke! I actually leapt here from 6 this evening!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2E)
【Rintaro】I know the outcome of today's RaiNet Grand Championship final.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADC)
【Faris】You don't have to tell meow. Overwhelming victory for Faris--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B80)
【Rintaro】Nope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C24)
【Rintaro】You lost.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD8)
【Faris】Nyau~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D7C)
Faris pointed her lips at my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E20)
【Rintaro】But that was because of the enemy team's interference. So to protect you, I brought you these sunglasses and earplugs--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC4)
I desperately tried to convince her, but Faris just hung her head, making it hard to read her expression--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F68)
【Rintaro】Are you listening!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000204C)
I grab Faris' slender shoulder, and she starts shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F0)
【Rintaro】Faris...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A0)
【Faris】Unyaaaaa
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002244)
【Faris】Kyouma you meow meanie!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E8)
And she suddenly exploded!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002396)
【Faris】Today is a very important match for Faris! How dare you say she loses nya! You're being mean to Faris! Are you a Viral Attackers' spy nya!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243A)
【Rintaro】N-no, look, you didn't lose because of ability but--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E8)
【Faris】Hmya! Not listening nya-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000287E)
【Rintaro】Hgg...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292E)
After kicking me in the shin, Faris turns around and points up her nose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D2)
Damn you catgirl! You're not listening now of all times...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AAE)
【Rintaro】W-wait! Wait I say!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B52)
【Rintaro】I'm in trouble unless you win!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C00)
【Faris】Like Faris said, she can't lose nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA4)
【Faris】And I don't wannya wear those ugly glasses nya! Faris is always cute, so she can't let down all her fans, nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D48)
Crap, she's getting angry at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF8)
Faris shakes me off, rushing to the participant entrance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E9C)
I'm not a participant, so it's over if she goes in there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F78)
【Rintaro】Please hear me out until the end!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000301C)
Bearing the pain in my shin, I force my way in front of Faris and stand in her way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030C0)
【Rintaro】Faris, please. Mayuri's life depends on it...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000316E)
【Faris】Someone! Someone come nya! Help meow!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003212)
Faris suddenly raises her voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032B6)
She grabs the attention of the surrounding participants and spectators. Even staff members are gathering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000335A)
Geh... Crap, I can't talk about time machines or Mayuri's life with this much attention around us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033FE)
But unless I can get Faris to hear me out here, it'll be impossible to change the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003576)
How should I overcome this...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B4)
【４℃?】Why, you seem pretty free, dontcha, Champion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037F6)
That smug voice resounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003972)
The tall man wrapped in matching black clothes walks up to us, grinning. Whenever he takes a step, all of the silver accessories he's wearing start to jingle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AB4)
He dramatically takes off his sunglasses, revealing the face of that bald spot guy I got in trouble with before. If I'm not mistaken, he called himself ４℃.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BEC)
【４℃】Heh. I am the black peacock of the RaiNetter realm who swooped down upon the street.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D24)
【４℃】My name's ４℃. The number 4 and ℃ as in "Celsius. 4℃". The leader of the Viral Attackers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E5C)
【Faris】Viral Attackers...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F94)
Hm? Viral Attackers. I think I've heard that name somewhere before...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040CC)
That's right! Faris' opponents for this match are the Viral Attackers!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004204)
This troublesome man's picking a fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000433C)
He's a dangerous character who suddenly headbutted me just a while ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004474)
And he seems to hate Faris a lot, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000462A)
【４℃】Seriously, you disappoint me, Champion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046E8)
【４℃】You flirt with the system, but that's just noise to my heart. And yet here you are before the match, soaking in the corrupted love of that bungling man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004700)
【４℃】That white fur of the Siamese cat you pretend to be: with this duel today, I'll dye it jet black. Gaia has thus whispered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004710)
【４℃】The black cat is the sign of disaster. My black radiance will outshine your shadow, bringing about RaiNet's new generation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004732)
Damn, this guy can talk. About what, I don't know, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004742)
Faris seems to be thinking the same thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004756)
【Faris】Why is everyone in Faris' way nya? I need it quiet so I can concentrate nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004772)
Saying that, she quickly tries to enter the hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004782)
I grab her hand to detain her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047C6)
【Rintaro】Faris, I told you to wait!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047D6)
【Faris】Let go nya-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047E6)
【Rintaro】Please, listen to what I'm saying--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004836)
【４℃】Hey, wait! Don't you disregard the man closest to the truth of RaiNet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004846)
【Rintaro】No, we don't need you, so don't look this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004856)
【４℃】The hell you say...! Don't you know I am the black nobleman of the RaiNet realm!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004866)
【Rintaro】Weren't you the black peacock of the RaiNet realm? You're contradicting yourself, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004876)
【４℃】I am the black peacock nobleman. 'Cause black is the symbol of RaiNet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004886)
The promotional posters all have a blue and white motif. At least, it doesn't look like black is the image color.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004896)
【Rintaro】What, so you just like to say black?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048A6)
【４℃】You dumbass. Before the final duel, I'm going to dye that pussy black.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048C4)
4℃ starts chasing her with an angry look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048D4)
But I'm the angry one. Mayuri's life hangs in the balance, so I don't want him to interfere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048E4)
Faris won't listen to me at all either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048F4)
I'm about to explode from all this frustation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004904)
How should I drive this guy away...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004914)
After a little consideration, I decide to face him as Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004924)
【４℃】Do you know what'll happen if you touch me? Dry ice can burn skin--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004934)
【Rintaro】That's not burning, but frostbite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004944)
【４℃】Wha--!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004954)
【Rintaro】I'm telling you to not meddle with Faris!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004964)
【Rintaro】If you're gonna do poetry, write on the back of a leaflet!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004974)
I hear giggles from all around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000498E)
【４℃】Hehhehhehheh, they're laughing at you, you corrupt pussy's l'amant!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000499E)
What the hell is l'amant...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049AE)
【Rintaro】But that's wrong. They're laughing at you, you balding peacock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049C8)
【４℃】Wha, now, you just shook my mind... You, how do you know about my untouchable black spot...!? I've never even told anyone about it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049D8)
4℃'s face turns red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049E8)
【Rintaro】Fear not, ４°F. For I am an insane mad scientist, and time leaper. The man who gazes at everything, Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049F8)
【４℃】It's not "４°F", it's "４℃"!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A08)
【４℃】I won't forgive... I won't forgive any of you. Because you put on pitiful pretentious names and summoned my garden, the black HELL...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A34)
While threatening us, he puts his sunglasses on and leaves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A44)
That's a little payback for headbutting me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A8C)
【Faris】Kyouma, just now, how did you see through 4℃'s weak point nyan? Nobody knew that information nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A9C)
【Rintaro】Didn't I say so? That I came from the future?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AAC)
【Faris】Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004ABC)
【Rintaro】More importantly, please, Faris. I want you to take them. It's okay if you just take them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AD6)
【Faris】...b-but. I can't believe that Faris loses nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AE6)
【Rintaro】You're superior in terms of ability. But you heard him talk. They're obvious trolls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AF6)
【Rintaro】They would do anything it takes for them to win.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B06)
【Faris】If you say that much...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B16)
Looks like my desperation paid off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B26)
Faris reluctantly accepts the two items I present to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B36)
Of course, she doesn't take them out of the bag, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B50)
【Faris】I'm really just holding onto them nyan. Is that okay nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B60)
【Rintaro】Yeah, they'll be absolutely necessary for the finals, so don't let go of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B70)
It looks like I got her to do it, even if she didn't like it.
