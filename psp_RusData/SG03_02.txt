We stayed up all night again.

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BA)
To clear away drowsiness, I fill my mug with another cup of instant coffee. I lost count already.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000502)
【Kurisu】Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000512)
Kurisu hands out the guest mug to me without looking away from the PC monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000522)
Looks like she wants some more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C0)
Since when did I become your maid? You should ask Mayuri, the professional maid for stuff like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D0)
That said, Kurisu's the one reading SERN's documents right now. Daru and I can somehow manage if we use translation software, but it's not very efficient.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E0)
It's a little off from our original goal, but I think it's best to borrow Kurisu's knowledge for this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F0)
That's why it's not a good idea to displease her now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006AE)
I silently take the mug from Kurisu, dump in the powdered coffee, and pour in hot water from the pot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006BE)
Two packets of sugar. No milk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006CE)
Kurisu had already requested it the same way five times today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DE)
I got accustomed to it too, so I prepare it without being told.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000754)
I mix it well and bring it over to Kurisu. She doesn't immediately realize I'm standing behind her, so I bring the cup out in front of her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000764)
Kurisu takes the mug without looking my way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000774)
【Kurisu】Thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000784)
She gives her grattitude, but she's engrossed with SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000794)
Even though she was that adamant about how they're traitors to researchers everywhere. How self-interested.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A4)
But I understand the feeling. Because I'm also itching to know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B4)
Daru's fast asleep on the sofa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C4)
His snoring is quite noisy. Furthermore, it seems like he has sleep apnea.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D4)
Kurisu's enduring the sound pretty well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E4)
Is she just that concentrated?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000860)
I decide to go channel surfing and see the usual topic on the news programs: the Radio Kaikan satellite crash.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B4)
【Reporter】Five days have passed in Akihabara since the satellite crash. The crowds are gathering to get a glimpse of the satellite which was left as-is.

【Middle School Girl】I came from Nagoya. I wanted to see it.

【Middle-aged Man】I took the train from Saitama. It's amazing-. Just where is that satellite from?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA8)
【High School Girl】Yay! I'm a student from Chiba-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4C)
【Reporter】People like these have been rushing here from all over Japan.

【Reporter】Also, in an interview earlier today, Michael Byrne, spokesman for <DICT>NASA</DICT>, America's aeronautics and space administration,

【Reporter】Suggested that a satellite had in fact not crashed in Japan, and that the crashed object was something else.

【Reporter】The fallen satellite is currently under police investigation. No estimated removal time has been set.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE4)
Is it really under investigation?

This could also be a plot by the "Organiza--

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102A)
The door unlocks from outside and Mayuri comes in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CE)
He has a convenience store bag in her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001172)
There are various foods inside, but the probability that they're for us is low.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001220)
【Mayuri】Wahh-, you know, it kinda seems like the air here is sooo thick.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C4)
The three of us who stayed up all night probably look pretty pale.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001368)
But now that we know about SERN, it would be weirder if we were lively.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001428)
【Mayuri】I'll go refresh the air, okay-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000144C)
Mayuri opens the window wide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145C)
The sky is so blue, it hurts my eyes. Large clouds listlessly flow in the wind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146C)
It's a truly fresh sight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A8)
Mayuri's appearance makes Daru get up with a grimace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
Kurisu also finally moves away from the computer, sipping her hot coffee.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
She rubs her eyes as if they're tired.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
I glance at the room's clock, and step forward to the center of the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E8)
【Rintaro】Since all lab mems are present and accounted for, this is the perfect opportunity to finally hold another Round Table Conference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160A)
【Mayuri】Roundabout confluence?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161A)
Mayuri tilts her head while munching on her okaka onigiri brunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162A)
【Itaru】...What's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163E)
【Rintaro】The lab mem debriefing, a meeting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001658)
【Itaru】Have we ever done that before?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001672)
【Kurisu】Where's this round table in the first place?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001682)
【Rintaro】There's no real one. However, it lies in the hearts of us lab mems. Correct?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A0)
【Kurisu】No, it's not "correct".
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
Don't go putting weird things into people's hearts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D8)
【Mayuri】Is there one in Mayushii too?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E8)
【Rintaro】Yeahh, there is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001702)
【Mayuri】I see-. That's good. But what's a roundable?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171C)
【Itaru】So, why a round table? You King Arthur?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001736)
【Kurisu】In the first place, I'm only a provisional lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001746)
Geez every last one of you has to whine about every little thing!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AA)
【Rintaro】Anyway, it's a Round Table Conference! Mayuri wasn't around last night, so for now, let's explain the current situation to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BA)
I talk to Mayuri about everything we established from last night to dawn this morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CA)
About how SERN is making a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017DA)
About jellymen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EA)
About how we might be attacked by black suits for knowing this outrageous confidential information.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FA)
【Mayuri】I even told you that bad things aren't good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180A)
【Rintaro】Hmph, bad you say? We are? How absurd.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181A)
【Rintaro】If you must say that, then SERN is even worse. Those guys have lost interest in controlling just the world, and now plan to even get their hands on time-space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182A)
【Kurisu】I agree.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183A)
For some reason, Kurisu backs me up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000184A)
【Kurisu】What SERN is doing is unforgivable to society, unforgivable to humanity, and unforgivable as researchers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185A)
【Mayuri】That's true, but-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186A)
Unsatisfied, Mayuri keeps eating her okaka onigiri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187A)
I didn't want to involve Mayuri, but she's surprisingly perceptive. She'd find out even if we kept it a secret. So it's better to just tell her at the start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A4)
【Rintaro】Anyway, with this, our lab can no longer escape the "Ragnarok" with SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B4)
I say that halfway as a bluff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C4)
In any case, we can no longer return.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D4)
Now that we know, we can no longer erase our memory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E4)
【Mayuri】Rag in a rock-...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F4)
【Kurisu】Norse mythology again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001904)
【Rintaro】Christina! I ordered you to investigate SERN, right!? Did you learn anything new?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001914)
【Kurisu】I don't remember being ordered, but whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001924)
【Kurisu】SERN faces two problems with time travel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001934)
【Kurisu】First is the adjustment of the Lifter, the electron injection device.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001944)
【Kurisu】Unless it functions properly, they can't make the Kerr black hole singularites naked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001954)
【Kurisu】If you try to send the test subject through the singularities in this state, they'll be compressed at the micro level via super gravity. Naturally, there's no safety for them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001964)
【Kurisu】And the second problem is that they can't designate the destination for time travel. They can't choose where they go after coming out of the singular point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001974)
【Kurisu】That's why we should actually consider the 14 found jellymen the lucky ones.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001984)
【Kurisu】Over a hundred human experiments were performed starting 2001. Basically, the remaining 80 or so people "jumped somewhere they can't locate".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A48)
【Mayuri】Why can't they locate them-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A62)
【Itaru】Mayu-shi, did you know this? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kilos, and its orbital speed is 114000 kilos--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7C)
Daru's triumphantly explaining to Mayuri, but he's relaying what Kurisu told him last night.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A8C)
【Kurisu】It seems like SERN's looking for solutions to these two problems, but it doesn't seem like it's going well for them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A9C)
So does that mean even SERN is having a hard time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B00)
【Rintaro】So, Assistant. Did you find anything out about SERN's time machine that could serve as a hint for the Microwave Ophone (Temp)?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B10)
【Kurisu】A hint, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B20)
Kurisu looks upwards in thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B30)
【Kurisu】To start with, you could call the LHC "the world's largest microwave oven".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B40)
【Rintaro】I see! So basically, that means the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is a miniature LHC, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B50)
【Kurisu】That might not necessarily be wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B60)
I was sure she'd deny it. In fact, I thought she'd yell at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B70)
But instead, she agreed with me. What an ironic anticlimax.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B80)
【Kurisu】However, there are too many things we don't know about the Microwave Ophone. Why do the same phenomena as SERN's time machine occur in that tiny little microwave?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B90)
【Kurisu】Unlike the LHC, this thing wasn't made for time travel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C54)
【Mayuri】It was made to warm Mayushii's karaage, right-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C6E)
【Kurisu】W-well, yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7E)
【Rintaro】At the very least, the jellyman phenomenom occurs with the Microwave Ophone (Temp), so we should think that Mayuri's bananas reach the Kerr black hole's ring singularity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
【Mayuri】It makes a black hole? Here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB2)
【Mayuri】It won't suck us in, will it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC2)
If it sucked us in, we'd become jellymen too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D26)
【Kurisu】But, we haven't been able to clarify the structure or outbreak conditions for the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D36)
【Itaru】During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send mail into the past during the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D46)
【Rintaro】We haven't succeeded a second time yet, but that discharge phenomenon could very well signify the injection of charge, that is, electrons.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D56)
【Rintaro】And only when it occurs does the path to the singular point open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D66)
【Kurisu】We don't know the cause of the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D76)
【Rintaro】That's what we're going to examine now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
【Kurisu】In the first place, the mails we're sending into the past are digital data, no physical objects. That's a definite difference from SERN's time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D96)
【Rintaro】No, what they do is the same. Who's to say that digital data can't go through a singular point? I'd think it would be easier than something human sized going through.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA6)
【Kurisu】Well... that's true...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB6)
【Mayuri】You know, I think it's confusing how you say "mail"-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC6)
【Mayuri】It makes me think of folding a letter into a paper airplane and making it go zooo-m, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD6)
【Rintaro】It's actually a light beam. Like optical digital data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE6)
【Rintaro】By the way, it's hard to keep saying "mail sent into the past", huh. Shouldn't we come up with a name?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF6)
【Kurisu】Going to add parentheses again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E20)
【Rintaro】Don't say "again"! You looking down on Hououin Kyouma!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E30)
【Kurisu】You just want to give it a strange name, don't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E40)
【Rintaro】Hmph, "strange"? How rude. Then allow me to announce it. I shall name the phenomenon of "mail sent into the past" as follows. The name shall be--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E50)
【Rintaro】"Nostalgia Drive"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E60)
【Kurisu】Confusing. Rejected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E70)
【Rintaro】Why, you! You think you have the authority to reject when you're just an assistant-!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E80)
【Kurisu】Then why don't we take a vote? All in favor of Nostalgia Drive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F44)
My hand cuts through the air on its way towards the ceiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F54)
But nobody else follows the same motion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F64)
【Rintaro】Have you forsaken me, Daru!? Mayuri!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000201A)
【Mayuri】I think Chris-chan's right-. Mayushii can't remember such a long name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C8)
【Itaru】It's too much pretentious bullshit, durr.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000216C)
Tch, everyone's a critic....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002264)
【Rintaro】In that case, have you guys thought of any names!? Don't tell me you just rejected my idea with no plan...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002308)
【Kurisu】I think the most important thing is for it to be easy to understand. It's mail that retroactively goes through time, so don't you think "Retromail" should be good?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023AC)
【Mayuri】What do you mean by "retro"-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002450)
Mayuri tilts her head while spooning out strawberry jelly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F4)
How can you just eat that after hearing about jellymen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002598)
【Rintaro】Mayuri's reaction should be enough of an answer, Christina. You said it should be an easy to understand name, but it wasn't easy to understand at all, was it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000263C)
【Kurisu】W-well that's because Mayuri-san is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E0)
【Kurisu】Ah, no, it's nothing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000279E)
【Rintaro】Were you about to say it's because Mayuri's dumb?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002842)
【Kurisu】N-no, I wasn't!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000299A)
【Mayuri】Eh, Chris-chan, do you think Mayushii is dumb...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A48)
【Kurisu】I don't. I don't think that in the slightest, so don't misunderstand. Okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AF6)
She can soothe Mayuri while giving me a sidelong glare. What a skillful woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BEE)
【Itaru】"The Mail who Leaped through Time" is a choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C92)
【Rintaro】That's a little stiff. It's hard to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D36)
【Itaru】Okarin's "Nostalagisticexpialidocious" was long too! And this references a movie title--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DDA)
【Rintaro】It should have romance. Romance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E7E)
【Itaru】You're rejecting it for that...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FD6)
【Mayuri】Ah, tutturu-! Mayushii got an idea-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003084)
【Mayuri】How about "Back to the Mail"!? I took a movie title, and stuck mail to it-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003136)
【Itaru】Mayu-shi, I already did the movie title joke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031E4)
【Kurisu】Besides, I think you got the meaning slightly wrong...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003288)
It would literally mean returning to mail. Certainly cryptic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000333A)
【Mayuri】he meaning doesn't matter-.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003354)
 I took a movie title, and stuck mail to it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003450)
【Rintaro】Either way, it's too long!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034F4)
【Itaru】Then how about "DeLorean Mail"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035AA)
【Rintaro】That doesn't even say what kind of mail it is anymore!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035C6)
【Kurisu】Hey. This isn't the time to be wasting time on such trivial things. Hurry things up and just abbreviate it to "D-mail".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035F0)
【Rintaro】No, but that's way too insipid...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B4)
【Kurisu】It don't care if it's insipid or if you don't like it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C4)
Rejection.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D4)
Before I noticed it, Kurisu's influence among the lab mem ranks seemed to grow substantially.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036EE)
【Mayuri】Then, let's decide on D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036FE)
Mayuri, finished with her jelly, proclaims in satisfaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000370E)
Wait, when did Mayuri become the speaker?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003772)
【Itaru】So, why does the D-mail phenomenon occur?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003782)
【Rintaro】Because the path of the ring singularity opens. I've said so before, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003792)
【Kurisu】We haven't confirmed whether or not black holes are formed. It could simply resemble SERN's time machine by coincidence, and be some entirely different phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A2)
【Kurisu】It's dangerous to rush to conclusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037B2)
【Rintaro】What are you saying? Don't you want us to make our own time machine? That's why we so bravely hacked into SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037C2)
【Rintaro】What we should be talking about is how we can make the Microwave Ophone (Temp) usable as a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037D2)
【Itaru】But-, do you think we can do it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037FC)
【Rintaro】I don't -think- we can do it. We will do it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000380C)
【Kurisu】What's with that spiritual supremacy doctrine? Are you an incompetent boss or something?

【Rintaro】Tch, damn you... You dare say those remarks about the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000382C)
【Itaru】Well, it's not like Okarin's a boss anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000383C)
【Rintaro】Indeed. I am the symbol of this lab, not a boss.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384C)
【Kurisu】I don't know what you mean by symbol, but how are you going to use the Microwave Ophone as a time machine? Tell me your concrete solution.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003876)
【Rintaro】Solution, huh... Right, there is one thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003886)
【Rintaro】We've been thinking it's random whether or not the discharge phenomenon occurs, but I have a hypothesis.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003896)
【Kurisu】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038A6)
I look at my watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038B6)
It's past noon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038C6)
【Rintaro】Reproduce the occurrence conditions, Christina. Last night, we did a lot of investigation. And then, we overlooked the simplest, most concrete "condition".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038D6)
【Rintaro】That is, the time of occurrence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038E6)
【Kurisu】...ah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F6)
【Rintaro】I checked the times of we the two occurrences of the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003906)
【Rintaro】And accordingly, when I accidentally sent the first D-mail to Daru's phone, it was somewhere around 12 and 13 o'clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003916)
【Rintaro】Then the second time, when all four of us observed the D-mail, it was 18 o'clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003926)
【Rintaro】So basically, if we experiment within those two times, we can possibly reproduce the effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003936)
【Kurisu】Let's try immediately...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039D8)
Assistant's eye color changes completely as she rushes into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E8)
【Itaru】At any rate, this assistant sure is in high spirits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ABC)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's banana supply has gone down-. I gotta buy more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ACC)
Only one safe banana remains.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ADC)
We ate the rest after the other experiment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AEC)
Not a single gelified banana remains on the bunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B34)
【Kurisu】Sorry, Mayuri-san. I'll go buy you some new bananas later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B4E)
【Mayuri】Really? That makes me happy-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B68)
【Mayuri】You know, Okarin and daru-kun just eat my bananas, but they never pay for them...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B78)
I'll be sure to amend that in the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B88)
If it's to bring chaos to the world, a bunch of bananas is a small price to pay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF6)
Kurisu picks the banana off the bunch, leans under the table, and places it inside the microwave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C06)
【Kurisu】First, let's see if it'll become a jellyman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D2A)
【Kurisu】Agh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D3A)
She tries to get up and gloriously bangs her head underneath the table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D4A)
【Rintaro】Quit the clumsy girl appeal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E20)
【Kurisu】It was an accident!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E30)
Blushing in embarrassment, Kurisu gets up. She appeals with teary eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E40)
【Kurisu】Do something about the microwave's placement. It's dangerous, and annoying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E50)
【Rintaro】It made a hole in the floor, so we can't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E98)
【Mayuri】Chris-chan, Chris-chan, pain, pain, go away-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EA8)
Mayuri pats the back of Kurisu's head, grandly waving her hand to the sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EC2)
【Kurisu】Thanks, Mayuri-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EEA)
Kurisu pulls herself together, types on the phone, and activates the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EFA)
The banana inside the microwave slowly begins to spin in reverse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F0A)
The 120 on the timer's display gradually decreases.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F52)
【Kurisu】Ah...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F62)
Peeping into the microwave, Kurisu raises her voice in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F72)
The banana teleported.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FEE)
It instantly returned from the microwave to the bunch, becoming a jellyman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004064)
【Itaru】Ohh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004074)
【Mayuri】It became a gelbana, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004084)
【Rintaro】Heh, heheheh... fuhahaha, fuuhahahaha! Just as I suspected, the occurrence condition was "time"!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004094)
I was half anxious in my innermost thoughts, but I'm relieved things went well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040A4)
I gloriously outwitted the impertinent genius girl. With this, I've secured my position in the lab-- as its symbol.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040CC)
【Kurisu】W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn't notice it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040DC)
Kurisu says that with a slightly sulky expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040EC)
【Rintaro】Is it vexing? But still, I appreciate your words of praise. Fuhahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004106)
【Kurisu】More importantly, lets see if we can reproduce D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004122)
Kurisu ignores my proud laughter and excitedly starts typing out a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004132)
【Rintaro】Tch, Hououin Kyouma's dignity is dropping thanks to Christina...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000417A)
【Itaru】I don't think you had any dignity to begin with.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041C2)
【Kurisu】Whatever, just help me, you two. Okabe, I'm sending a mail to your phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041D2)
It's like she's pushing us around...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041F2)
While grinding my teeth, I insert my phone into the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s slot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004242)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, Chris-chan, what are you sending-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004252)
Mayuri peeks at Kurisu's phone, almost hugging her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004262)
【Kurisu】It doesn't really have to mean anything. We just need to confirm whether or not we can send it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004272)
【Mayuri】Hmm? Lemme see here, Okabe wazu un airhe...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004282)
【Rintaro】
Wait. Assistant over there, what are you typing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000429C)
【Kurisu】Who knows? Ready? I'm sending it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042B8)
Daru already operated the microwave's timer through the X68000. Nothing's inside, but the microwave still operates. The countdown starts from 120.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004318)
Now's where the timing counts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004328)
We have to suddenly open the microwave door while it's operating, but we've yet to verify the timing of sending the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004338)
With that said, we'll do them simultaneously for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004348)
Kurisu readies her finger on her phone's send button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004358)
I firmly grasp the microwave door's handle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004368)
Mayuri seeks cover.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004378)
【Itaru】I'm starting the countdown, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004388)
The microwave timer soon indicates 70.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004398)
【Itaru】3, 2, 1... zero.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043A8)
Almost simultaneously, Kurisu sends the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043B8)
And I open the microwave door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004622)
【Kurisu】Kyah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004632)
【Rintaro】Fuuhahahaha! It's coming...! It's coming you guys!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000464E)
Light flashes across the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000465E)
The cushioning underneath the Microwave Ophone (Temp) collapses under the weight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000466E)
The floor starts creaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000467E)
Exactly like the discharge phenomenon that occurred before--!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000470C)
The discharge phenomenon itself ended in a few dozen seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000471C)
Everybody looks at the Microwave Ophone (Temp) underneath the table with bated breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000472C)
Luckily, it didn't break through the floor. That's a relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004774)
【Kurisu】...Did the mail arrive?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004846)
I disconnect my phone from the Microwave Ophone (Temp), and check my mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004856)
Kurisu peeks at my phone screen from the side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A9E)
I received some mail in English.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AAE)
Two mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004ABE)
The timestamp was five days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AD8)
【Kurisu】Pfft...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AE8)
Kurisu wrote that mail herself, yet she starts laughing when she sees it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AF8)
The "Okabe" in the first one is clearly my name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C20)
But what does "airhead" in the second one mean? Atmospheric skull?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C30)
I don't quite understand what it means, but I do understand this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C40)
My assistant is making fun of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C56)
No, that doesn't matter right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C66)
【Rintaro】Christina, did you send two mails?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C80)
【Kurisu】Eh? No. I only sent one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004CC8)
【Mayuri】Mayushii saw too-. You know, she only sent one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004CD8)
【Rintaro】But I received two of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004CF2)
【Kurisu】That's true... It was one sentence, but it got divided.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D02)
【Rintaro】By the way, what does this sentence mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D1C)
【Kurisu】Why don't you look it up yourself?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D2C)
Doesn't look like she wants to answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004DDE)
【Itaru】That reminds me, the D-mail from before was cut up mid-sentence too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004DFC)
【Rintaro】Was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E1A)
【Itaru】Yeah. Look at your arrival history. I'm pretty sure I sent "Okarin's a pervert".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000054B8)
【Rintaro】It certainly is cut up into two as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005500)
【Kurisu】I wonder what the cause could be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005510)
【Rintaro】It could be related to jellymen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005558)
【Mayuri】But, but, you know, Mayushii's more concerned about why it arrived five days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005568)
【Kurisu】That's true. Last time we sent one, it arrived five days ago too, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005578)
【Rintaro】Yeah. It did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055C0)
【Itaru】Is it some sort of rule then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055DA)
【Mayuri】Then, then, let's try sending even more-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055EA)
It's just like Mayuri said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055FA)
Now that we've reproduced the discharge phenomenon, as well as D-mail, we should keep experimenting and get as much experimental data as we can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000560A)
【Rintaro】Alright, lab mems, battle stations!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000562C)
【Kurisu】He's at it again...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000563C)
【Rintaro】Henceforth, we shall continue D-mail experiments for as long as possible!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000564C)
【Rintaro】Daru, use the X68000 to observe, adjust, and gather information on the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005666)
【Rintaro】Assistant, keep pumping out mail. Try out various patterns of text. Japanese, English, full-width, half-width, emoticons. The contents don't matter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005680)
Shining Finger is more qualified to type out mail, but since she's not a lab mem, I'll leave this role to Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000569A)
【Mayuri】What about Mayushii?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056AA)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, I order you to go shopping. For now, buy some bananas. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall fund you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056C4)
【Mayuri】Wah-, Okarin's so generous-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056DE)
【Kurisu】Then Okabe gets to open and close the microwave door, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056F8)
【Itaru】Uhyoh-. Isn't that job as simple as "putting the dandelion on sashimi"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005708)
【Rintaro】Hmph, no, Assistant's judgment is accurate. Most likely, the key to a successful D-mail is the timing of opening the microwave door!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005722)
【Kurisu】No, I was just kidding...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005732)
【Rintaro】Fuhahaha! Just leave opening and closing the microwave door to Hououin Kyouma! With the accuracy of God, the audacity of Asura, and the delicacy of handling women!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000574C)
【Mayuri】Wah-, Okarin, naughty-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000575C)
【Rintaro】Furthermore, the current operation is top secret. You must not leak it to anyone. Got it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000576C)
Mayuri nods steadily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000577C)
【Rintaro】Now, I shall announce the operation name--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005796)
【Kurisu】Don't need one. Let's start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000057B2)
【Rintaro】What did... you say...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000057C2)
You ruined my climax scene....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000057D2)
Tch, damn assistant, that's unforgivable...!
<FILEEND62>
