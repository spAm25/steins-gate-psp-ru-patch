The night of the 17th passed, and the night of the 18th passed, and Mayuri still didn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001F0)
I've watched the state of affairs for three days since then. The result: No sign of Moeka's attack, No sign of any accidents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000200)
That's when I first had confidence that everything's alright now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000210)
With Daru's help, I disassembled the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and the IBN 5100 into scrap. With this, we can no longer send D-mails ever again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000220)
And at the same time, SERN-- the Rounders, will no longer have a reason to target us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000230)
In the Braun Tube Workshop underneath the lab, the manager was watching the 42 type Braun Tube TV, like always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000240)
No matter how much I searched the web for past news, I couldn't find any information on the satellite that crashed into Radio Kaikan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000250)
Obviously, since there was not one scratch on Radio Kaikan's walls, and it's open like usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000260)
In place of news on the satellite crash.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000270)
In the evening paper of 28th of July.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000280)
In the local section, in a small article.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000290)
It was mentioned that Makise Kurisu had been murdered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A0)
After that, there was no follow up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B0)
In other words, the culprit has still not been caught.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C0)
I talked to Daru about it, and apparently, the police called me, the first discoverer, many times to ask about the circumstances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D0)
But I don't have a single memory of that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E0)
Anyways, Mayuri didn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F0)
I've reached my goal--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000044E)
【Mayuri】Okarin♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000045E)
Coming out of the station's ticket gate, Mayuri waves her hand and rushes over to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046E)
Running through the gaps between shoppers and maids handing out leaflets, she stares at my face with puppy dog eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BE)
【Mayuri】Ah... oooh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CE)
【Rintaro】Wh-why are you crying...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DE)
【Mayuri】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EE)
Without answering my question, Mayuri gently strokes my cheek.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FE)
She's crying, but she doesn't seem sad, rather, she seems to be overcome with emotion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000050E)
【Mayuri】Okarin, you came to pick me up, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000051E)
【Mayuri】You were waiting for Mayushii... hau, I'm so happy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000052E)
【Rintaro】Don't get so happy over every little thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000548)
【Mayuri】Ehhehe-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000558)
Mayuri shyly and innocently wipes away her tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000572)
【Mayuri】So, Mayushii class changed from Okarin's Hostage to Okarin's Lover, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000582)
【Rintaro】...indeed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000592)
I'm stumped as how to deal with such embarassing words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A2)
Mayuri and I started going out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B2)
Well, in these long, painful 20 days, I noticed how important Mayuri is to me, and she told me that she loved me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005CC)
【Mayuri】Thank goodness... It wasn't a dream-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005DC)
【Rintaro】Okay, okay, let's get going to the lab already. You'll die of heatstroke if we keep standing in this damn heat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F8)
I start walking without waiting for Mayuri's answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000608)
【Mayuri】Eh-? But you know, isn't the lab really hot too-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000618)
【Rintaro】Well, it's true we only have an electric fan. I'm thirsty too. I need my Dr Pepper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000628)
Sunday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000638)
On this hot day, like always, Akiba is full of shoppers enjoying themselves, carrying many bags and walking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000648)
I suddenly feel emptiness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000658)
The everyday scenery where nothing changes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000668)
Yet it seems like a part of my everyday is chipped off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000678)
An illusion like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000688)
There's no mistaking that the cause of that emptiness is how Kurisu is missing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000698)
But there's no such thing as a perfect future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A8)
There's no such person who can obtain it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B8)
I need to understand that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C8)
This current reality is the future I wished for and won.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D8)
Because the most important thing to me is right next to me. Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E8)
It was good luck that I even got this far.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F8)
I'm blessed far beyond the common man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000764)
Suddenly, I look to the side, and Mayuri is gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000774)
I look over my shoulder, and still can't find her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000784)
【Rintaro】Mayuri...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000794)
She disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A4)
Mayuri was always like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B4)
She would always get distracted and disappear somewhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C4)
I'm impulsively attacked by uneasiness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D4)
I said Mayuri disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E4)
If Mayuri disappeared, then there's no point in my choosing this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F4)
【Rintaro】Mayuri!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000804)
I shouted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000814)
I look all around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
The crowd of people is in my way, making it hard to look for her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
【Rintaro】Mayuri!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
【Mayuri】I'm over here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000898)
And, Mayuri is running from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A8)
In her hands... is shaved ice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C6)
【Mayuri】Ehhehe-♪
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E0)
 Okarin, you said it was hot, right? So I thought, why not eat this together?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F4)
【Rintaro】Don't surprise me like that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000904)
I feel relieved inside, and wanted to embrace her small body, but stopped myself since we're in public.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000914)
I take the shaved ice and hold out my empty hand to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000924)
【Rintaro】Hold my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093E)
【Mayuri】Okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A6)
Mayuri takes my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B6)
Her slender fingers intertwin with mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C6)
【Rintaro】Let's save the shaved ice for when we get to the lab. It's a bother to eat on the way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D6)
【Mayuri】Eeh-? But then, it'll melt, won't it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
【Rintaro】Can't do anything about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
【Mayuri】I see-. Welp, can't do anything about it, then. If we're holding hands, we can't eat anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A06)
【Rintaro】I-I won't let go. I won't ever let go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A16)
【Mayuri】Mayushii won't let go either-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A26)
Mayushii puts just a little more strength into her grip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A36)
A loving grip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A46)
While we walk side by side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0E)
Mayushii suddenly looks up at Radio Kaikan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B28)
【Mayuri】Heyhey, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B38)
【Mayuri】Is it possible to dream even when you're awake?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B48)
【Rintaro】Dream...? You mean a daydream?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B62)
【Mayuri】Is that what it's called? Okarin, you're so smart-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B88)
【Mayuri】Well, it was about someone, I don't know whom, but it feels like Mayushhii had a very important friend-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B98)
【Rintaro】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA8)
【Mayuri】And whenever I think about that important friend, it's painful, and my heart goes all kyuu-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC2)
【Mayuri】And sometimes, I can hear a voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD2)
【Rintaro】A... voice?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBC)
【Mayuri】The voice says "Find happiness".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
【Rintaro】Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D38)
Everything should have never happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D48)
The memories were erased. Sacrificed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D62)
【Mayuri】I think it might be because that person said so, that Mayuri is here together with Okarin like this-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D72)
But she faintly remembers events she experienced in the other world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D82)
Her memories of that time are very vague, but they're certainly still there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D92)
And perhaps, she's recognizing them in the form of dreams, daydreams, or deja vu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA2)
【Mayuri】If I meet that person, I want to tell them thanks-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB2)
I'm not the only one who remembers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCC)
【Mayuri】Who could that person have been-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDC)
【Rintaro】...it was probably God.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF6)
【Mayuri】I see-. Thank you, God.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
【Mayuri】Mayushii is really happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E6E)
If God exists, he's probably above the sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E7E)
Looking up, Mayuri whispers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8E)
Like she usually does, she raises one hand to the sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9E)
She shakes hands with the stardust twinkling above the painted blue sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC8)
I too, look up to hold back the tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF2)
Together with Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F02)
We join hands, and keep on walking--
<FILEEND02>
