#WRITE(PTR, $00000328)
--The feeling of another warm hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000338)
Slips through my fingers with a strong sense of vertigo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047A)
The shrine grounds are here, unchanged.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000048A)
But I no longer feel her clinging to my body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000049A)
That feeling slowly slipped away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000546)
【Luka】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000556)
Lukako is standing a little bit away from me, looking at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000566)
As if seeing me off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000576)
No tears are on that face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000586)
A bewildered smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000596)
My chest falls into an illusion about to burst.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A6)
Hold it back--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B6)
【Rintaro】Hey, Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C6)
【Luka】Yes?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D6)
【Rintaro】You're--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E6)
I hesitate for a moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F6)
But I make up my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000606)
【Rintaro】A guy, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000620)
【Luka】Yes, I am, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000630)
She was no longer there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000640)
But instead, he was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000650)
Cute facial features like a girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000660)
Looks good in miko clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000670)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000680)
I tightly bite my lip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000690)
Lukako went back to being a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A0)
【Rintaro】Do you... like me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006BA)
【Luka】Eh, what's this all of a...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006CA)
【Rintaro】...Do you like me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DA)
【Luka】Ummm, well...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EA)
【Luka】I respect you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FA)
Just what part of me is respectable? I'm not that sort of proper man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070A)
But that's not what matters now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071A)
Lukako's answer seemed clear, but wasn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072A)
He didn't say he liked me or he hated me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F2)
【Luka】If I become a guy again... then I'll have to suppress my feelings for Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084C)
Even now, when he became a guy again, Lukako might still like me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085C)
But he can't speak honestly about those feelings. No matter how much time flows.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086C)
And because Lukako has prepared himself for that, I can't trespass into his heart any more than this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087C)
I might be running away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088C)
Maybe I should trespass instead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089C)
But I'm not that strong a man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AC)
If I did trespass, then I might just end up hurting Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BC)
That's why I couldn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008CC)
【Rintaro】Thanks. From now and forevermore, I want you to be my disciple... Is that okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E6)
【Luka】Eh, ah, yes, of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000940)
I cast down my eyes, unable to look straight into Lukako's shy face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000950)
The world line changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000960)
Lukako became a guy again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C0)
In that case, the IBN 5100 should have returned to this shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D0)
In the world line where Lukako was a girl, she was cleaning the storehouse and broke the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E0)
But now, since Lukako became a guy again, he shouldn't have cleaned the storehouse, and he shouldn't have broken the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009FC)
Looking at the clock, it's 6:46 PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0C)
It's likely that we avoided Mayuri's death for today. But to prepare for the worst case, I should get back to the lab within the hour.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A38)
【Rintaro】Lukako, last year, do you remember breaking an old computer in the shrine storehouse?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A52)
【Luka】An old computer...? I don't think we had that, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A62)
【Luka】I don't really understand computers... I haven't played with them much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A72)
When Lukako was a girl, she trembled when I asked her the same question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A82)
And then she smiled as if to hide the worry and pain of not wanting to say I broke the computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A92)
But now he's not trembling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA2)
Lukako honestly doesn't know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB2)
【Rintaro】Go get your father for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B16)
I asked Lukako to fetch his father for me like always, so I could ask him whether or not the IBN 5100 was dedicated to the storehouse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B26)
【Luka's Father】An old computer... Hmm, certainly, I do remember that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B40)
【Luka's Father】I'll go check. Please wait a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B58)
He says so, heading into the treasury in back, just like in the previous world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B68)
But in the previous world line, since Lukako secretly moved it, the IBN 5100 was no longer in the storehouse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B78)
How will it turn out this time...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBC)
Luka's Dad returns after about 10 minutes. His face was serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCC)
I knew what to expect at that point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDC)
Even in this world line, I knew it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEC)
【Luka's Father】I couldn't find it. It's gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFC)
I quickly peek at Lukako's face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C40)
Blank. He doesn't seem to know anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C50)
Lukako is innocent. I'm sure of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C68)
【Luka's Father】The storehouse lock was broken. Someone might have taken it away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C78)
【Rintaro】Taken it away...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C88)
It didn't disappear, but was taken away?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C98)
So basically, a thief broke in!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA8)
【Luka's Father】There's evidence of a heavy object being dragged. That wasn't there at the end of the year cleaning, and the lock wasn't broken when I checked last month.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB8)
【Luka's Father】I didn't think a thief would break in...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D36)
【Luka】So, we need to report it to the police...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D46)
I sigh a little while listening in on the Urushibara's discussion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D56)
【Rintaro】There's no point if it's not in the storehouse...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D66)
It still won't come back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D76)
There's only one, or maybe two D-mails left that I should cancel. Which one?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D86)
If I just cancel that one, I can get back the IBN 5100. That's how I feel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA0)
【Luka】Um, Okabe-san. I don't really understand, but... please stay careful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB0)
【Luka】Uh, I mean, you don't have to if your heart isn't in the right place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCA)
I made a bitter smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDA)
Seeing Lukako frantically cheer me on is so adorable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEA)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFA)
【Rintaro】You're using that phrase wrong, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0A)
I point that out and leave the shrine.
