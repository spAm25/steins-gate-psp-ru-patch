In the end, I listened to the whole of Kurisu's lecture at ATF.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E8)
After the 2 time travel theories she introduced at the beginning, she explained all the others in an easy-to-understand manner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F8)
There were some blunders in the beginning, but she got used to it, and by the end it was an impressive lecture... It made me doubt that she's an 18 year old first timer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000808)
I got to give it to her for responding to my malicious questions with sarcasm. That's some nerve she has-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000818)
W-wait, why am I praising her!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000828)
Well, leaving that aside...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000838)
I saw that Makise Kurisu has died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000848)
However, she is alive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000858)
My memories are contradicting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000868)
Not only about Kurisu, but the things I talked about with Mayuri and Daru, as well. The inconsistency in my memories has been proven by reality itself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000878)
This problem can be easily solved if I just leave it at "I saw a dream or an illusion".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000888)
However, there's still the possibility that it wasn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000898)
And so--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000910)
After I part with Daru at ATF, I decided to come here, the Yanabayashi Shrine...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000920)
...with the purpose of getting exorcised.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000930)
I greatly doubt that the Makise Kurisu I saw at ATF was a ghost.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000940)
Regardless of that, wanting an exorcism after what I saw is something normal for a Japanese person. It's in our blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000950)
Yanabayashi shrine can be found by entering the first side road after passing the Mansei Bridge. It's a small shrine which doesn't fit in with the surrounding buildings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000960)
There's the more famous Kanda Shrine in Akiba, but I prefer this one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000970)
The area around the shrine is very confined.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000980)
Regardless of that, I can hear the cries of cicadas from the few trees growing here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A14)
【Mayuri】Oh? It's Okarin! Tutturu~♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A24)
In front of the shrine building, there are 2 girls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A34)
One of them is Mayuri...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEC)
And another one, - a docile-looking girl wearing shrine maiden clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFC)
...Though, it's a mistake to call her a "girl".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0C)
This is Urushibara Luka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1C)
The "son" of this shrine's chief priest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2C)
Yes, a son.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3C)
No matter how you look at him, he looks like a lovely girl, but... he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCC)
【Luka】Okabe-san, hello.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7A)
He makes a quick bow to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8A)
His voice and behavior makes him look like a female.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9A)
Or more like, more feminine than a female.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF0)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D04)
Taller than Mayuri, and of a very slim build.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D18)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2C)
Looks good in shrine maiden clothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D40)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D54)
He's holding a broom, so I'm guessing that he was in the middle of cleaning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D68)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7C)
It's so hot, even though it's almost evening.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D90)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA4)
The damn cicadas won't shut up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB8)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E68)
【Rintaro】Lukako, what happened to the blade that I gave you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E78)
He is an acquaintance of mine, and I call him Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E90)
I helped him when he was surrounded by a group of retards with cameras in some <DICT>mall</DICT> and we have known each other since then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA0)
By chance, Lukako and Mayuri are classmates in the same high school.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB0)
I found this out after I became acquainted with Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECA)
Lukako is taken aback by my sharp question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDA)
With a blushing face, he's fidgeting as if he's gonna start crying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEA)
【Luka】Eh, uhmm... You're talking about the demon sword, "Samidare", right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFA)
【Rintaro】Right. I bought that for you so that you could control your powers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1C)
【Mayuri】Ah, but you bought that in Akiba's "<DICT>Main Weaponry Shop</DICT>", didn't you? For 980yen, I think--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2C)
【Rintaro】Mayuri! If you speak any further, you will be erased by "them"! Don't ever talk about that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4A)
【Mayuri】Eh? Erased?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F64)
Okarin, thank you for worrying about me... But, but who are "they"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F78)
I ignore Mayuri's question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC8)
【Rintaro】So, Lukako. Do you use the "demon sword, Samidare", just like I told you to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE2)
【Luka】Y-yes, I practice swinging once every day...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF2)
【Rintaro】With it, you can master theSeishin ZanmaMind-Killing Demon style, and prevent the evil flames that sleep within you from burning you up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001002)
"Demon sword, Samidare" is a fake blade, but that is because it is hiding it's true form from the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001012)
If it's in the hands of a skilled master, it will release it's true power.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001022)
It is a cheap purchase that I got for 980yen (tax included).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001032)
However, even if it is a fake, the police would not let it slide if you were to walk around the town with it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001042)
That's why I always remind Lukako to "not walk with it within the town".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
【Luka】Thank you, Okabe-san, for this wonderful present.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106C)
【Rintaro】I am not Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B4)
【Mayuri】You're Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CE)
【Luka】I'm sorry, Kyouma-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DE)
【Rintaro】It's okay if you get it. Now, the password.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EE)
【Luka】Ah, uhmm, El... Psy... Congaryu...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FE)
【Rintaro】Wrong! It's not Congaryu, but Congroo!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001118)
【Luka】Y, yes!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001128)
【Luka】El... Psy... Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001138)
【Luka】I-is that fine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001148)
As I smile, Lukako makes a happy smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001162)
【Luka】Thank you very much!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001172)
Loveliness to which anyone could fall for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D4)
But he's a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001368)
【Mayuri】What a nice teacher-student relationship... Mayushii isn't a <DICT>fujoshi</DICT>, but this is somewhat exciting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001382)
【Luka】Eeh? Ma, Mayuri-chan, don't imagine anything weird...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001392)
Seriously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A2)
Though, the "teacher-student relationship" part is true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BA)
I, Hououin Kyouma, with the use of my <DICT>Mind Control</DICT>, taught Lukako about the conspiracies and ruling structures of the world, and instructed him on how to fight them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CA)
The talk about "demon sword, Samidare" and so on, are linked to that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013DA)
Disregarding his looks, personality-wise Lukako is very obedient and honest, and a hard worker at that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EA)
Moreover, he's the one who said that he wants to be taught many things, and as a master, I am greatly pleased with this disciple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FA)
However, he doesn't process what I say too quickly, and has theminusweak point of being too shy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001478)
【Rintaro】So, why is Mayuri here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001488)
【Mayuri】I came here to see Luka-kun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A2)
【Mayuri】I keep asking him to come to next month's <DICT>Comima</DICT> while cosplaying as %B2SKirari-chan%B2E from "Rai-net", but he doesn't want to do it, at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
【Luka】But, cosplaying, is too embarrassing for me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
【Mayuri】But, but I just know that Luka-kun would look good in it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E4)
【Mayuri】You'd become very popular as "<DICT>Too cute to be a girl</DICT>", you know. Come on, let's make a cosplay debut.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F4)
Mayuri has the hobby of making cosplay. Up until now she has made more than 30 costumes, but she herself almost never wore any of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001504)
She seems to feel supreme joy in seeing someone else wear them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001514)
And, apparently, she seems to have chosen Lukako as her next target.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001524)
Obviously, Mayuri is currently making the cosplay of a popular female character.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001534)
I don't really think that I understand why Lukako doesn't want to wear those clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001544)
I mean, he's already wearing shrine maiden's clothing and all, so I don't see why he would be opposed to cosplay... It's not so different, after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001554)
I sigh, and restrain Mayuri, who is urging Lukako to do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001564)
【Rintaro】Leave such trivial things for later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000157E)
【Mayuri】Eeh? But it's very important for Mayushii...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158E)
【Rintaro】But for me, it's trivial!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159E)
【Rintaro】Besides that, Lukako, the reason I came to the shrine is to get an exorcism. Can you do it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
【Luka】An exorcism? Then, you should be asking my father...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
【Rintaro】No, it's nothing that serious. I just need some peace of mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
That's why I came here instead of the Kanda Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E8)
【Rintaro】So, bring the usual "thing" over here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001602)
【Luka】Eh? The usual "thing" is... The "Samidare"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001612)
【Rintaro】Wrong! Who the hell uses a demon sword for exorcism!? I obviously mean the "thing"!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162C)
【Luka】Uhmm... uh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163C)
【Rintaro】
I don't know what's it called, but it's the rod thing with white paper attached to it, the one that Shinto priests swing around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001656)
【Mayuri】Ahahah~, the explanation just now was very childish, Okarin♪.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001666)
I'm quite shocked that Mayuri is the one who said it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001680)
【Luka】Ah, the OonusaShide wand, right? But I don't know if my father would lend it to me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169A)
【Luka】I'll go and ask him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B6)
Lukako made a quick bow, and hurriedly ran off towards the residence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C6)
Mayuri is checking the time on a pocket watch that she took out from her bag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170E)
It's an old-fashioned item which doesn't look like something that a high school girl would have.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171E)
Apparently, the name is "Pockety".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172E)
Obviously, it's a name that Mayuri gave it, and definitely not some brand name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173E)
I am quite aware of the fact that she has been carrying "Pockety" with her at all times ever since elementary school.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174E)
For Mayuri, it's a treasure more valuable than any other item.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176A)
【Mayuri】Well, it's almost time for my part-time job, so I'm gonna go now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177A)
【Rintaro】Okay, then do your best. Are you going straight home afterwards?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001794)
【Mayuri】Yep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A4)
Mayuri's parent's home is in Ikebukuro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B4)
She takes the train to come here almost every day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C4)
Since we're childhood friends, my real home is in Ikebukuro, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D4)
Ever since the start of the summer holidays, I have been living in my lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E4)
【Mayuri】Okay, then, see you tomorrow!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001800)
I stop Mayuri, who was about to trot off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001848)
【Rintaro】...Mayuri. That time at the Radio Center... Did you hear a man's scream?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001858)
【Mayuri】A scream...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)
Mayuri blinks several times and puts her finger against her forehead, pretending to think hard. And then, she puts on the usual smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001878)
【Mayuri】When did that happen, again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
【Rintaro】Today's noon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A2)
【Mayuri】I don't think I heard it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B2)
【Rintaro】...Right. Okay then, I understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CC)
【Mayuri】Okarin, you're weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E6)
【Mayuri】Bye, then. Tutturu~♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001902)
Mayuri passes the archway and runs off while waving to me until I can't see her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194A)
【Luka】Okabe-san, sorry to keep you waiting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195A)
As if to replace Mayuri, Lukako returns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196A)
In his hand, he's holding the weird tufty thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001984)
【Luka】I was able to borrow it. What a relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199E)
【Luka】Huh? Mayuri-chan left already?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AE)
【Rintaro】Lukako, don't worry about Mayuri and start the exorcism already!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C8)
【Luka】Ah, yes. Are you really fine with me...? What exactly am I supposed to exorci
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DE)
Lukako is getting nervous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EE)
Right after I think about how unreliable he is, chills suddenly run down my spine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A1A)
【Rintaro】Ugh, An evil spirit... Has possessed... Me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2A)
While violently shaking, I grab my own wrist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3A)
【Rintaro】Kuh... Calm down, you wicked being... Hurry, Lukako... At this rate, it will take control... of me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A54)
【Luka】No, no way...! Okabe-san, please get a hold of yourself...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A64)
【Rintaro】I am not Okabe-san...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7E)
【Luka】I apologize, Kyouma-san...! Aah, but what should I do...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A8E)
【Rintaro】The exorcism... Hurry...! Do it the same way... That I taught you...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA8)
【Luka】Y-yes...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0C)
Lukako puts on a serious look, and tightly grips the Shide wand with both hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B1C)
His posture and expression makes him give off a powerful atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2C)
【Luka】Uhm... I... Err...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B3C)
Lukako is stuttering with a completely red face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B4C)
Looks like he's hesitating about what he's about to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B5C)
The embarrassment is making him panic... Kuh, damn this novice...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6C)
【Rintaro】Lu...ka... Please, drive out... the evil spirit... from inside me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7C)
【Rintaro】I... don't want... to kill you...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B8C)
【Luka】Uuh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9C)
Lukako starts crying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAC)
Looks like he's really worrying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBC)
I am completely aware that he's a guy, but his actions and appearance make me feel guilt as if I just made a frail girl cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BCC)
But, as his eyes get filled with tears, it looks like he finally built up the resolve.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BDC)
【Luka】E, evil spirit...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BEC)
He raises the Shide wand high above his head, and then swings it left and right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BFC)
【Luka】Please leave from Okabe-- no, Kyouma-san's body...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C0C)
【Rintaro】That's good, now hit my arm with the tufty stuff...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C6A)
【Luka】Eii!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7A)
The end of the Shide wand hits my upper arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8A)
In manga and such, this would be the cue for some dramatic shockwave to occur, but nothing like that happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C9A)
The only thing I hear are the cries of cicadas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CDA)
【Luka】H, how... was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CEA)
I deeply sigh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CFA)
The shaking of my hand has stopped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D0A)
【Rintaro】...It's fine. Looks like the evil spirit has left. Well done, Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D24)
After a sigh of relief, Lukako blushes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D34)
【Luka】I'm happy, to be of service...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D44)
That bashful appearance makes him look too feminine...
<FILEEND3E>
