#WRITE(PTR, $00000832)
When I come to, I'm standing still with my phone hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000842)
While waiting for the ringing in my ears to calm down, I promptly check the date and time on my phone screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000862)
August 11, 2:21PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000872)
Alright. Now I have two more days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000882)
As a matter of fact, I've gone back 52 hours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000892)
I first jumped to the 13th at 14 o'clock, when the machine was completed. From there, I leaped the limit of 48 hours to the 11th at 14 o'clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A2)
It was my first time doing consecutive time leaps, but it seems to have gone well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B8)
I immediately head to where Suzuha is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C8)
Thanks to time leaping, Suzuha's hand wasn't burned in the first place. What a relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D8)
When I explain the situation, Suzuha rushes to Radio Kaikan to confirm what I said. She believes me when she notices the time machine is broken.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6A)
We repeat the same conversation we had before I time leaped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7A)
In the end, all we can do is ascertain whether Suzuha's time machine can be repaired or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8A)
【Itaru】Then, we should go look at it right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9A)
Daru's unusually eager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAA)
Maybe he's interested in Suzuha's story about the world's structure and the act of history revision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC4)
【Mayuri】Hey, wait wait-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD4)
And Mayuri flaps her hands and calls us to stop as we're about to leave the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE4)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey. Guys, you're forgetting one more thing-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFE)
【Itaru】One more thing? What's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C18)
【Mayuri】Where's Suzu-san's father now-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C28)
Ah, that's right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C38)
But I thought Suzuha was lying about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C48)
Yet Suzuha unexpectedly hangs her head painfully.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C98)
【Suzuha】...Father doesn't really matter, does it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB2)
【Mayuri】It does so matter-. I mean, won't it take time to fix the time machine-? In that case, Mayushii thinks we should search for Suzu-san's father in the meantime.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
【Mayuri】Whaddya think?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDC)
【Rintaro】No, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF6)
I hesitate when Mayuri's cheeks start swelling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D06)
【Mayuri】Ahh-, Okarin, that's no good-. You know, promises are meant to be kept.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D16)
Promise...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D26)
【Mayuri】Just before, we promised, right-? That we'd all look for Suzu-san's father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D36)
That's right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D46)
When she couldn't meet him, we promised that and detained Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D56)
【Rintaro】Yeah, that's right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D70)
【Mayuri】You know, Suzu-san did come here on a mission and stuff, but I think it's also because she really wanted to meet her father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D80)
【Mayuri】In that case, Mayushii wants to help them meet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D90)
If Mayuri says that much, then there's no way I can refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAA)
【Suzuha】Shiina Mayuri, you're really a good girl...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBA)
Suzuha sniffles a little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD4)
【Suzuha】...exactly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE4)
【Suzuha】I thought that if I came to this town, I could meet him...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFE)
【Suzuha】I know that Father was in Akihabara in 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0E)
【Rintaro】Wai- he's really here!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E28)
【Suzuha】He is. How rude. At this age, he's probably still young and cool.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E38)
【Rintaro】His name... was Barrel Titor, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E48)
【Suzuha】Yeah, that's right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E62)
【Mayuri】Waah, a foreigner-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E72)
【Suzuha】No. He's probably Japanese. Barrel Titor is his codename from the Resistance time. So now, in 2010, I don't think he calls himself that yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E82)
I see. So that's why Suzuha called herself John Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9C)
【Suzuha】Father's real name... I don't know it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EAC)
【Suzuha】Even though I'm his real daughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBC)
Suzuha looks like she's about to cry for an instant, but she quickly covers it with a bitter smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED6)
【Suzuha】He never told me it, and before he could, he died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE6)
That part about the age Suzuha lived in makes me think she's even more heroic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF6)
【Rintaro】So, what about the name Amane?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F06)
【Suzuha】My mother's maiden name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F56)
【Kurisu】So, no clues?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F70)
【Suzuha】Clues... ah, that reminds me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F80)
Suzuha claps her hands together and starts feeling around her body. Finally, what she takes out of her pocket is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
【Mayuri】A pin badge?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
What Suzuha has always been fiddling around with.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106C)
Its form is nothing special.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107C)
A common pin badge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108C)
【Mayuri】Something's written on it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109C)
It reads OSHM***A 7010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AC)
【Suzuha】This is Father's memento.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010BC)
【Kurisu】Memento...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D8)
【Rintaro】Daru, google it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E8)
Daru looks it up on a search engine, only to be brought to unclear foreign sites.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001166)
【Suzuha】Father was seemingly around Akihabara, so I think we can leave out the foreign sites.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001176)
【Itaru】So in Japanese please, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001186)
We narrow down the search to Japanese sites.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001196)
But even the top 10 results were unrelated sites.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A6)
【Itaru】I don't get it at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F6)
【Mayuri】But, but-, this will surely be a hint-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001206)
With Suzuha's permission, I take a picture of it for the time being.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
【Mayuri】With that said-, all in favor of searching for Suzu-san's father-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001226)
I was about to say We don't have that much free time, but the time machine's lack of function means we can't do anything. So maybe we can just let Mayuri do what she pleases.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001236)
Because now that I know about attractor fields, I know that even if I take Mayuri to the ends of the earth, we can't avoid her death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001246)
【Rintaro】...I don't oppose it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001260)
【Mayuri】Thank you Okarin-♪ Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127C)
Daru raises his hand too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000128C)
Followed by Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129C)
So, with unanimous approval, we'll search for Suzuha's father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E4)
【Suzuha】Everyone... thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012FE)
【Suzuha】But, to the very end, I would prefer to go to 1975. Because that was my father's dying wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130E)
【Suzuha】So, if it looks like we can repair the time machine, what do you think if we give up the search for Father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001384)
【Mayuri】Is that okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001394)
【Suzuha】I think if we can't find him after searching that much, it just means we weren't fated to meet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A4)
It helps me out for Suzuha to say that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F4)
【Itaru】So, how are we going to search?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001404)
【Rintaro】The pin badge is our only hint. Our only starting point. They say every man knows his own business best, so let's try going to maniac shops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141E)
【Suzuha】Maniac shops?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142E)
【Rintaro】Akiba has plenty of underground maniac specialty shops, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001592)
It's hard to sneak into Radio Kaikan in the daytime.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A2)
The boom settled, but there's still quite a few pedestrians in front of the building.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B2)
We spend about 30 minutes just sneaking in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C2)
I have Kurisu keep working on the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D2)
She needs to have it complete by the 13th at 14 o'clock. If it's late, that'll have a huge effect on time leaping to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E2)
Mayuri disappeared into Akiba by herself to search for Suzuha's father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F2)
【Rintaro】How is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001602)
I call out to Daru, who's checking out the flooded satellite-- I mean, time machine, as Suzuha and I stand guard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001612)
The hatch only opens when someone whose fingerprints have already been registered-- in this case, Suzuha-- touches the hatch area.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165A)
Fed up, Daru crawls out of the machine while sweating profusely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
We hurriedly pull out that huge body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167A)
The satellite-- time machine, is completely visible from below.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168A)
If someone were to see us, they might report us to the police.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169A)
The festival's mostly ended, but many people still come to see this satellite. We need to be as careful as we can to not get noticed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AA)
【Itaru】...It's so freaking hot in there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
【Itaru】It's not on the level of a steam bath... Underneath this blazing sun, the machine's seriously turned into a food dehydrator...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D4)
【Itaru】By the way, this machine won't lose its balance and fall, right...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E4)
The satellite-like time machine stands still as if scraping off the wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F4)
But the police fixated the pointed end with something like rope, so Daru probably has nothing to worry about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170E)
【Suzuha】Can it be fixed?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171E)
【Itaru】Nah, I still don't know for sure. But I noticed something just by touching it for a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001738)
【Itaru】This thing kind of seems like the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001748)
【Rintaro】Then maybe it can be fixed, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001758)
【Itaru】Nah, that's why I said I wasn't sure. I need to check a little more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001768)
【Rintaro】Daru. Supah hakah. I can say that everything depends on your skill.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001778)
【Rintaro】You're the supah hakah who saved the world. In 2036, you will be respected as the 'Mother of the Time Machine' instead of Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
【Itaru】It's not hakah, it's hacker! How many times do I have to tell you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
【Rintaro】Anyway, get it done somehow or another in two days, Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B2)
I place my hand on Daru's shoulder and frantically plead with my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
【Rintaro】You're the only one I can count on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017DC)
【Itaru】I'm not confident. Anyway, why two days?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EC)
【Rintaro】That's...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FC)
Because Mayuri will die. But I don't say that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001816)
【Suzuha】After two days, the weather conditions will be perfect for creating the ring singularity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001826)
【Suzuha】If we miss that, we won't have another chance for a year.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001836)
Nice excuse, Suzuha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001846)
【Rintaro】Y-yeah, that's it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001860)
【Itaru】Fix it in two days? That's just nuts...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001870)
【Rintaro】But if you do, you'll get the right to go on a date with Faris for a day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000188A)
【Itaru】...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189A)
【Rintaro】Can you fix it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B4)
【Itaru】Yes, I can!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C4)
Well then... the problem is whether or not Faris will hear that request out...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EC)
OSHM***A 7010
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019FC)
We're searching for something with that same cryptic logo as the pin badge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A0C)
I didn't think it would be this difficult. Honestly, we were too naive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A1C)
Akiba has plenty of underground shops, but they're all for electronic goods and PC parts, so there aren't that many accessory shops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2C)
We went around all of them, but couldn't get a single clue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3C)
We tried showing it to the salespeople, but they all just tilted their heads to the side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A4C)
We walked all the way to the station, to questionable shops in Kanda, Ueno, and Asakusa, but still no results.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5C)
Suzuha and I walk back home with a heavy gait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE2)
【Kurisu】Welcome back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF2)
Kurisu, secluded alone in the development room, greets us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C02)
【Kurisu】Your faces say no results, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C12)
【Rintaro】Where's Daru?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2C)
【Kurisu】He didn't come back. It's already dark, so didn't he go straight home?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C3C)
Since it's nighttime, the closed Radio Kaikan's too dark to work.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4C)
He can't use a flashlight either because that would be too conspicuous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5C)
Mayuri's not around. Is she making any progress on the search for Suzuha's father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C76)
【Suzuha】I kind of feel bad. This isn't the time to be doing this...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C86)
【Rintaro】This isn't for you. Everything is to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C96)
【Suzuha】...yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA6)
I start up Daru's computer and try searching the net for pin badge collector communities.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB6)
I'll investigate tomorrow based on the information I find.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC6)
There's a pin badge community in Frepara, where everyone shows off their collection, so I posted asking for information.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC2)
I'm sleeping on the couch when a loud alarm rings in my ears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED2)
【Rintaro】--SERN's attack!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EFE)
I jump up and see Kurisu and Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F0E)
Kurisu's holding a phone. The sound's coming from there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F1E)
【Kurisu】Good morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F2E)
Her sour face said the morning was not good at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F3E)
I wish she'd put herself in my shoes and see what it's like to be woken up with such a sour attitude.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F5A)
I check the time with my own phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F7A)
It's before 7AM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F8A)
【Rintaro】...so you came to wake me up? Thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F9A)
【Kurisu】It's not like I made a morning call for you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB4)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro, there's something I want you to see. So I had her wake you up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200C)
A strange meter is placed on top of the lounge table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000201C)
【Rintaro】...What's this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000202C)
【Suzuha】A Divergence Meter. It can display the numerical value of the world line we're currently on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000203C)
The meter displays 0.337187％.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000204C)
【Suzuha】The numerical value of my original world line in 2036 is set at 0％, so at the end, it's just a relative number, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E4)
【Rintaro】You made this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F4)
【Suzuha】No. I brought it from 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002104)
【Rintaro】Hmm, these are Nixie tubes, huh? Nice sense. Enough that I'd certify it as Future Gadget No. 9.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000211E)
【Kurisu】What exactly is the mechanism behind this thing? I didn't think it possible to quantify world lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000212E)
Suzuha shrugs her shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002148)
【Suzuha】I dunno either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002158)
【Rintaro】You don't know!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002168)
【Suzuha】Do you know who made this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002178)
Why's she asking me if I have no way to know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002192)
【Suzuha】You did, Okabe Rintaro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A2)
【Rintaro】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B2)
【Suzuha】You made it. Ummm, I'm sure it was... about 11 years from now. You apparently put your special ability to practical use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021C2)
【Rintaro】Is that so...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
【Kurisu】If we have this meter, then people other than Okabe can check world line divergence. Is that it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021F6)
【Suzuha】No, that's not it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002206)
【Suzuha】Most likely, even if the displayed number were to change, only Okabe Rintaro would notice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002220)
【Kurisu】Haah? Then there's no point. Make something useful for once, Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002230)
I ignore Kurisu's complaints and look at the meter again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002240)
This, is something I made.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002250)
Fifteen years have passed since I completed it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002260)
Eleven years will pass before I complete it.
<END>

Feels kind of weird.

【Suzuha】The only one who understands the mechanism is the maker himself. You'll have to wait 11 years to know. If you do that, then he should figure it out himself.

【Rintaro】Have you met me in the future?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022AA)
She did say I was an infamous terrorist.

#WRITE(PTR, $000022BA)
For some reason, Suzuha's expression momentarily darkens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D4)
【Suzuha】...not once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E4)
【Rintaro】I see...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F4)
【Rintaro】So, what's the point in showing me this meter here and now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000230E)
【Suzuha】Once the meter's value crosses 1％, you'll have reached the β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000231E)
【Rintaro】1％...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000232E)
【Suzuha】Right. If you break 1％... you'll save Shiina Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000233E)
The glowing red numbers don't move at all now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234E)
It just needs to be raised a mere 0.6％, so it seems simple enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000235E)
Though there are six digits after the decimal point. Considering that the it doesn't have a tens place, I expect that raising the number is going to be hard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000236E)
【Suzuha】I'll give this to you. There's no point in me keeping it anyway. Use it well.
