I recline on the sofa with phone in hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000026E)
A high-school baseball game is broadcasted on TV.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000027E)
I understood just by seeing the high schools' names. Kumamoto and Aichi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000028E)
A prickling pain runs through my brain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000029E)
The buzzing in my ears won't calm down either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002AE)
It's hard to endure this unpleasant feeling right after time leaping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002BE)
Looking at the clock, it's about 1:45.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002CE)
What was going on at this time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002DE)
In about 15 minutes, Kurisu will finish with the Time Leap Machine. She's just starting the final touches, so I don't have anything in particular to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002EE)
The pain in my brain pulls away. This time, the top of my head starts throbbing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002FE)
Why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000030E)
Ah, that's right. Right before this, I got in a fight downstairs at the Braun Tube Workshop and Manager introduced his fist to my noggin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032A)
Mayuri's at her sewing machine making her costume.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033A)
Daru's at his computer, single-mindedly gathering moe images.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000034A)
Kurisu's in the development room adjusting the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000035A)
I end up waiting for 15 minutes in the same position.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000410)
And then the sound of the sewing machine suddenly stops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000420)
【Mayuri】Okarin, Okarin. Come here a bit-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000430)
She holds the costume and tells me so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000440)
【Mayuri】Can you hold this for me-? Spread it out like "fwapp"!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000488)
【Itaru】Mayu-shi, say that fwapp again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000498)
Daru overheard from his computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B2)
【Mayuri】Fwapp!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CC)
【Itaru】I got a fwapp!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DC)
【Kurisu】Stop it already, you perv.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EC)
Following Mayuri's directions, I spread the costume out by the sleeves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FC)
【Mayuri】Mm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000516)
【Mayuri】Yup, thanks-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000526)
Her face looks a little tired, perhaps since she stayed up all night.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000536)
But Mayuri's face was all smiles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000546)
【Mayuri】Finished-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000556)
Umm, I was supposed to say something now, but I don't remember what...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000566)
I can't remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000580)
【Mayuri】I finished before Chris-chan-. It was a competition-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000590)
【Kurisu】You win, Mayuri. Well done.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A0)
【Kurisu】But I'm finished here too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000674)
Kurisu finishes connecting the two cords she's holding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000068E)
【Kurisu】Complete
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A4)
Alright, now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B4)
【Rintaro】We won't experiment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DA)
【Kurisu】Eh!!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EA)
Crap, was that too soon...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000704)
【Kurisu】Hey, don't just suddenly refuse like that... Why do you think I worked so hard to make this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000714)
【Rintaro】Time leaping raises heaps of problems. I want to inspect them all carefully.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072E)
【Kurisu】Hu-huh... That's quite an honest opinion for you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000836)
【Mayuri】What sort of problems-? Isn't it complete-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000846)
【Rintaro】I'll explain in detail some other day. Everyone's tired now, so let's disband.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000860)
【Itaru】We're not going to go all out and celebrate its completion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000870)
【Rintaro】That's also for another day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000986)
With that out of the way, I drive Mayuri and Daru out of the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000996)
Mayuri borrows my phone charger since we use the same brand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A6)
Kurisu tries to go home too, but I secretly keep her back.
