We come back to Yanabayashi Shrine empty-handed, dyed scarlet by the setting sun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000082C)
Lukako's hand lets go of mine after we had held them all the way back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000083C)
And then she turns to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000884)
【Luka】This really is farewell, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000894)
【Rintaro】Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A4)
【Luka】I'm really happy... that I could train with Kyouma-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B4)
She looks shy again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C4)
But her cheeks are dyed pink.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D4)
I could tell she was desperately holding her tears back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E4)
The meaning of those tears are different than the ones before I time leaped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F4)
That's what I'd like to think.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000904)
【Rintaro】I... didn't really do anything lover-like for you, did I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091E)
【Luka】That doesn't matter to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092E)
【Rintaro】Ahh. I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093E)
Because Lukako smiles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000094E)
I'm sincerely relieved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000968)
【Luka】...Please save Mayuri-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000978)
【Luka】Because Mayuri is... a really important friend to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000988)
【Rintaro】Lukako...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A2)
【Luka】Ahaha, um, please, go already. If you don't... I might cry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BC)
【Luka】So, please...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009CC)
【Luka】Thank you, for everything until today...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
【Luka】Ah, in times like these, I use the usual password, right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
【Luka】Umm, El Psy Congaly...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A06)
【Rintaro】It's Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A16)
I wryly smile unintentionally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A26)
Lukako also forces a laugh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A40)
【Luka】El Psy Congroo, then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A50)
She bows deeply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A60)
She doesn't raise her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A70)
A sign for me to please go already.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE4)
I turn back to the torii at the entrance to the shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF4)
My feet are heavy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B04)
They won't advance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B14)
I stop in front of the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3E)
Then I take out my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6A)
【Kurisu】Hello, Okabe? Mayuri called me. She was mad. You stood up her promise to go to ComiMa, or something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C86)
【Rintaro】Christina... please enter the number I'm about to say into the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA2)
【Kurisu】What? Explain yourself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBE)
【Rintaro】Please, just do it... I'm sending the D-mail now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCE)
I hear a sigh on the other end of the phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDE)
【Rintaro】The number is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEE)
I tell her Lukako's mother's pager number, and one more thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFE)
"*2*2292983183129298318312929"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0E)
MeatMeatVegVegMeatMeatVegVeg...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1E)
If she sees this, Lukako's mother would probably think it's a prank.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2E)
And then, she'd think the D-mail we sent earlier is also a prank.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3E)
And if that still doesn't change the world line, we can just try saying something else.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4E)
The pagers in 1992 didn't have a number display function, so the sender's phone number isn't shown. So Lukako's mother won't know who sent it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5E)
I already told Kurisu the timer setting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6E)
Everything's set now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D92)
Once I get confirmation that the 42in Braun tube TV is on, I hang up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA2)
Now I just need to call the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB2)
Then the world line will change--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDC)
Lukako will turn back into a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF8)
His memories will disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4E)
Mayuri won't die today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6A)
But.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7A)
I'm hesitating to open my address book.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8A)
I think about Lukako, who's probably still watching me from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9A)
I wonder what sort of face she's makking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAA)
I want to check, but I don't think she'd let me turn back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBA)
Lukako finally smiled for me today, but reservations still linger inside me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCA)
This time, I'm about to sacrifice Lukako's memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDA)
The memories of the 17 years she lived as a girl in this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEA)
The memories of her parents, who rejoiced the fact she was born a girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFA)
I'm about to undo all of that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100A)
If I don't, I would deny the 17 years Lukako lived as a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101A)
I would deny the memories of her parents, who rejoiced the fact he was born a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102A)
But still--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103A)
Is it okay to turn Lukako back into a guy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104A)
Confused at what I should do, I can't advance forward.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105A)
The two memories I've sacrificed so far--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
Suzuha and Faris' crying faces cross my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FC)
I--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
Feel a soft impact on my back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
Lukako is embracing me from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001546)
【Luka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001556)
I hear faint sobbing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001566)
What expression is she making now? I know, even without looking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001576)
【Luka】I... really don't... want to change back...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001586)
I feel the pain of thin needles stabbing my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001596)
【Luka】Because... because...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A6)
【Luka】If I change back into a guy... I'd have to seal my feelings for Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B6)
【Luka】I don't think I should love Okabe-san if I'm a guy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C6)
I'm not against homosexual love.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D6)
But unfortunately, I am heterosexual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E6)
I wouldn't be able to answer guy Lukako's feelings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F6)
【Luka】And... my memories of today, will vanish too, won't they...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001606)
【Luka】That we held hands and walked together...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001616)
【Luka】That we trained together after such a long time...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001626)
【Luka】That I touched Okabe's body like I am now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001636)
【Luka】I don't want to... I don't want to forget...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001646)
【Luka】Because I love you... I love you, Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001656)
【Luka】I do want to save Mayuri-chan too, and I understand that there's no other way, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001666)
【Luka】It's still... painful...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001676)
【Luka】At the very least, I want... to keep my memories of today...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001686)
【Luka】If I knew it would end up this painful...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001696)
【Luka】Then I never would have wished to become a girl...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A6)
【Rintaro】Lukako...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B6)
【Luka】Sniff...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C6)
【Luka】I'm sorry. I know you don't think that matters... sniff...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D6)
【Rintaro】Even if you turn back into a guy... Lukako will still be Lukako to me. That won't change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E6)
【Luka】Yes... You saying that, makes me happy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F6)
【Luka】Okabe-san... Please, send that mail...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001706)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001716)
【Luka】Please. Send it, quickly...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001726)
【Luka】If I get to feel your warmth any longer... I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001736)
【Luka】I might say even worse things...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001746)
【Luka】I can't... hold back my feelings anymore, so...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001756)
【Rintaro】But...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001766)
Is this okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001776)
Is this really okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001786)
【Luka】Okabe-san... please...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001796)
I'm about to sacrifice someone again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A6)
Is it okay for me to decide this on my own?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D6)
The fingers holding my phone are shaking--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181E)
And, those fingers, are wraped up in Lukako's warm hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001898)
【Luka】Will you remember... me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B6)
【Rintaro】...Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D4)
Now if I just call the Microwave Ophone (Temp), I can send a message to Luka's mother's pager before she's born.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F2)
【Luka】Will you remember... the time I was a girl?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001910)
【Rintaro】...Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192E)
If I make the call--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194C)
【Luka】Will you remember... these short four days when we were lovers?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196A)
【Rintaro】...Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA4)
Lukako places her finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB4)
On top of mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC4)
On top of the Send button--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADE)
【Luka】Thank you... Okabe-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEE)
【Luka】Farewell. To the one... I loved--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
WD10.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002026)
【Rintaro】No, I can't do it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002040)
【Luka】Okabe... san...? Why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002050)
【Rintaro】I can't do it anymore... I can't sacrifice anybody else's memories...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021E6)
So far, I've trampled over both Suzuha's and Faris' memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021F6)
I pretended to not notice their suffering, all the while telling myself It's all for sake of saving Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002206)
I alone will remember their memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002216)
That was my justification, but it was just a convenient excuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D2)
【Rintaro】I don't have... any right to do that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E2)
I genuflect on the spot, brokenhearted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F2)
Nothing can save Mayuri but sending D-mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002302)
Currently, there are no alternative methods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002312)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002322)
Even so, I don't have the right to erase Lukako's entire life as a girl...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002332)
I can't do such an arrogant thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002342)
More than anything, I didn't want to lose the Lukako standing here before me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002352)
【Luka】Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002362)
...Mayuri can't... be saved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002372)
Mayuri's death is... fate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002382)
No matter how many world lines I cross, the resulting world will converge, according to the Attractor Field theory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002392)
Mayuri will die, no matter what...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024EE)
I'm already tired.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002536)
Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002546)
I wasn't enough of an egoistic human being to sacrifice everything for your survival's sake...
<FILEEND48>
