【Rintaro】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F2)
I look around after suddenly feeling intense stares.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000902)
A crowd has gathered around us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000912)
We're surrounded...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000922)
These unfriendly stares...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000932)
Are these people jealous Faris-fans who think we're a stupid couple...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000942)
I start shivering, but it doesn't seem like that's the case.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000952)
Then who are they...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000962)
Moeka's Rounders!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AA)
【４℃】Yo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BA)
A man clad in all black clothes slowly steps forward.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009CA)
I recognize this man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009DA)
The bald spot guy, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009EA)
He got hasty and lost.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009FA)
Wait, this guy again...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0A)
Now that I get a good look, all of the men surrounding us are dressed like ４℃. So are all of these guys Viral Attacker underlings...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1A)
４℃'s gaudy white teeth shine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
【４℃】I've got something to say to the champion. Gaia whispered for me to object.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A72)
【Faris】Object?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8C)
【４℃】You pussy. Just now, that power to read your opponent's heart...? Just what sort of trickery is that!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9C)
【Rintaro】It's not a trick! Didn't you make a mimicry of that yourself!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB6)
【Faris】Faris doesn't do scaredy-cat things like you guys nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC6)
【４℃】What was that? I, the black nobleman, swear to the god of the elegant evil realm, that I do no trickery! ...I don't know any other way, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD6)
【４℃】Okay, you violated white Siamese cat? I don't accept my defeat. That last "Change Directory" was a trick.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE6)
【Rintaro】That's irresponsible to say without proof.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF6)
【４℃】Hmph, looks like you don't know, so I'll tell you. "What I say is black is black". That's the truth of RaiNet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B06)
These guys came here to make completely false accusations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B16)
Doesn't look like they'll take no for an answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B26)
And they've surrounded us so we can't escape.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B36)
【４℃】By the way, your father's a guy who everyone in Akihabara knows, huh. And so you pulled your connections at the RaiNet AB Grand Championships.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B46)
【４℃】Basically asking all the staff members to let you win. There are those sorts of rumors among RaiNetters, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B56)
【４℃】What a huge scoundrel. You're not a bit elegant evil. You're not a white Siamese cat either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B66)
【４℃】You're a fat pig creeping in the mud.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B80)
Zawazawa, zawazawa...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B90)
A murmur grows little by little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA0)
When I take a good look, outside the wall of Viral guys, spectators coming home from the RaiNet tournament are surrounding at a distance in curiosity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB0)
The Viral surrounders start jeering loudly so that they can hear it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC0)
【Viral Attacker A】Seriously? I thought it went way to well, but it was basically a staged, rigged race?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
【Viral Attacker B】That cat lady's the worst!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE0)
【Viral Attacker C】So Faris was that sorta person eh. Filth. Pure Filth!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFA)
【４℃】That's how it is, Champion. No, SHAMpion Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
【４℃】Genuflect right here. Bow before me, the black Lucifer, ４℃, rub your head on the ground, and beg for mercy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1A)
【４℃】And forfeit your throne. If you do all that, then I swear to Lucifer to forgive you for your forgery.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2A)
【Viral Attacker D】That's right! Turn down your victory!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3A)
【Viral Attacker E】And never turn back to RaiNet Access Battlers again!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4A)
【Viral Attacker F】Retire from RaiNetting, you bitch!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5A)
Jeers fly about from the Viral surrounders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6A)
The bystanders watching the black mass around Faris and I don't approach. I guess they don't want to get involved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7A)
What a farce.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8A)
How much longer will we have to go along with this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9A)
【Rintaro】Let's go, Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB4)
【Faris】Nya...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD0)
I grab Faris' wrist and force our way through the Viral surrounders--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8A)
Looking back while frantically running, I see--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F26)
【４℃】Hold it right there!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F36)
４℃ and his surrounding group are chasing after us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
With the sound of rushing footsteps beats in our hearts, Faris and I do nothing but throw out one foot in front of the other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106E)
...What, a phone call now of all times!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001204)
【Rintaro】Hello!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001220)
【Itaru】It's me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123C)
【Rintaro】What!? I'm! Busy! Now!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001258)
【Itaru】Okarin, you still at the hall?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001274)
【Rintaro】I'm not!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001290)
【Itaru】You haven't seen Faris-tan, have you? They're actually on fire--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012AC)
【Rintaro】On fire!? What is!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C8)
【Itaru】Faris-tan's blogs and Faris-tan's fan sites are!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E4)
Tch. I see. That's what he meant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F4)
False suspicions are already flooding the net.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001304)
Damn Viral Attackers. Using such cheap tactics!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001314)
【Rintaro】Hanging up!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132A)
I press the end call button and run even faster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BE)
It's an emergency! Like hell I can answer!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CE)
I disregard the call and run even faster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150E)
【Faris】Kyouma! Those guys are! Still following nyan!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151E)
【Rintaro】Tch...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152E)
Still. I can still run!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153E)
Even though! I said! I was bad at running!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000155A)
While devouring oxygen, I pull Faris by the hand and run faster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D8)
We zigzag across the streets of Akiba until we loop back to UPX.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E8)
Faris' house is right next door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F8)
We should've run there first.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001708)
【Rintaro】Haah, haah, hooh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001718)
【Faris】Haahaah, hooh, hoooh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001728)
My lungs are on fire.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001738)
My legs are aching.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001752)
【Faris】Kyouma! Look at that nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001762)
【Rintaro】Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
Faris strongly pulls my sleeve, stopping me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
When I peek at where Faris is silently pointing--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
Near the entrance to the high class celebrity apartments, several clearly unbecoming trolls clad in black are loitering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
Gh, they knew we would come here...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BC)
【Faris】We can't get in like this nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CC)
【Rintaro】Anyway, let's leave!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187A)
We cut through Yodobashi, heading to Showa Dori, but get found en route.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000188A)
【Viral Attacker A】Ah, there they are!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189A)
【Viral Attacker B】Send the info to the mailing list!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AA)
【Rintaro】...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BA)
Damn, just how many of them are there!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CA)
All we can do is turn back in a panic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001970)
If we keep running like this, we won't make any progress.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001980)
We need to find a calm place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001990)
The lab. We can manage if we escape there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A0)
We need to reach there somehow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEA)
But Virals are loitering around the lab's circumference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AFA)
We can't carelessly approach the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA0)
【Rintaro】Hooo, hoo, Haahaahaah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB0)
Before I noticed, we came here...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC0)
The ramen shop behind the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD0)
But in another world line, "MayQueen+Nyan⑯" was here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE0)
Faris and Mayuri worked as maids there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C28)
【Faris】Why are we stopping here nya? We need to run quickly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C38)
MayQueen's second floor seemed to now be the storehouse for the ramen shop downstairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C48)
...Actually, we might be able to hide there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C58)
I urge Faris and run up the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF8)
In the empty room are piles of what seem to be wheat flour bags for the ramen shop downstairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D40)
Faris and I slip into cover and hide our breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D50)
We came here on our own... We can just pray nobody saw us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D60)
【Rintaro】Anyway, let's wait here until those guys give up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DFA)
I take out my phone and open the mail writing screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E98)
I send Daru an SOS mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F36)
Faris and I are currently hiding above "Ramen Tasaburou".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD4)
It's mostly empty with some sacks of wheat flour.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002072)
Nothing that looks useful as a weapon, and nothing big enough to hide behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002110)
The Viral Attackers are chasing us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021AE)
It's not a place that seems like you can hear people talking. I wouldn't have a problem taking on one or ten guys, but Faris is here, so I can't just go crazy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000224C)
Daru, please call us a taxi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002270)
I finish writing and send it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F8)
【Rintaro】--whew
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002308)
Ah, it's still hot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002318)
I'm so thirsty since we've been running in severe heat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002328)
【Rintaro】Haah, haah... If only MayQueen were here, we'd have air conditioning, and I could get something to drink, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002342)
【Faris】Nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002352)
【Rintaro】Oh, nothing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002362)
When I say whatever was on my mind, Faris makes a dubious face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002372)
【Faris】Kyouma, how do you know the name of the maid cafe that was scheduled to open here nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002382)
【Rintaro】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023A8)
【Faris】Wait, I know, we opened up the homepage for a little bit to post maid recruiting informationyan. Kyouma, did you see it nya-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B8)
【Rintaro】...It was scheduled to open?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C8)
【Faris】Faris planned it and passed it through the conference. It was almost a done deal nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E2)
【Faris】But at the end, Papa said no, and the plan died nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F2)
【Faris】Ahhh, Papa's such a blockhead nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000240C)
【Faris】If he left the store to me, it would've become the best maid cafe in all of Japan with hanya~n costumes and kyunkyu~n maids.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002426)
【Faris】It would've even pulled customers from Ueno and Ikebukuro to Akiba... How disappointing nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002436)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002446)
The former Akihabara with shops filled with games and anime and 2D bishoujo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002456)
The current Akihabara, transformed into a retro electric town.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002466)
The maid cafe, "MayQueen+Nyan⑯".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002476)
The storehouse, of the ramen shop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002486)
If you add things up, Faris shouldn't have been this attached to RaiNet Access Battlers in the previous world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002496)
【Rintaro】Faris, no, Akiha Rumiho.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B0)
【Faris】Hanyan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C0)
【Rintaro】Since you're the Akiha daughter and heir, you go to the Akihabara city development conferences too, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D0)
【Faris】Nnya? I don't go, nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E0)
【Rintaro】You don't? But you said so...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F0)
She said so before the world line changed?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002500)
【Faris】Papa goes to the conferences nya. So why would Faris have to go nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002510)
【Rintaro】Conversely, why did you go to the conferences...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000252A)
【Faris】Like-I-said- I don't go to them nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000253A)
That's right. Why would a high school girl go to that sort of conference in the first place?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000254A)
Not to mention, Faris said she was the (self proclaimed) propagator of moe shops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000255A)
Moe shops began to multiply in Akiba around 2002 right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000256A)
Back then, Faris was still 9 years old, man!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257A)
...This might be a hint to the D-mail Faris sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258A)
【Rintaro】Faris, your dad's a retro PC lover, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025A4)
【Faris】Exactly nya. Oh, now that you mention it, we still haven't found an IBN 5100 nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025B4)
【Rintaro】By the way, has your dad ever relinquished any retro PCs?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C4)
In another world line, Faris' dad dedicated the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D4)
No wait, did Faris do that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E4)
【Faris】Never nya. Papa loves all of the PC's he's collected nya. It's unthinkable that he'd relinquish any nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F4)
Then why was it dedicated...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002604)
【Rintaro】Do you have any retro PCs, Faris?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000261E)
【Faris】I don't get Papa's hobby at all nya. Faris likes cosplay and anime and cute things nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000262E)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000263E)
The reason the moe shops disappeared was because Faris didn't participate in the city development conferences.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000264E)
I guess that's what the D-mail was about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000265E)
【Rintaro】Let's say you participated in city development ever since you were a child.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002678)
【Faris】Then I think I'd put moe shops all over Akiba nya. Just go to ComiMa and you'll see how amazing otaku power is nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002688)
【Faris】More people would probably visit Akiba nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002698)
【Rintaro】That aside, if you no longer wanted to participate after participating for all that time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A8)
【Rintaro】How would you stop yourself in the past?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C2)
【Faris】Is this some sorta psychological test nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D2)
【Rintaro】Simply hypothetical talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
Faris ponders for a while--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026FC)
【Faris】Hm... a dramatic way is best nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000270C)
【Rintaro】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000271C)
【Faris】A drama-like development nya. Faris is the type to really believe that stuff. I probably got that from Papa, nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000272C)
Is that so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274A)
【Faris】So, for example, if Faris were kidnapped or--
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002764)
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002778)
Suddenly, Faris fell silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002788)
A dark room. I couldn't quite read her complexion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000279E)
【Faris】...kid...nap?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027AE)
【Rintaro】Faris?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027BE)
What's wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CE)
Faris holds her head, confused.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027E8)
【Faris】Ugh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027F8)
【Faris】My head hurts nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002812)
【Faris】H-hey, Kyouma... Faris has been feeling funny since coming to this storehouse nya... Even though I only came here once when I was little...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002822)
【Faris】It feels... really familiar nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002832)
【Faris】Like I've walked around here... countless times nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002842)
What does this mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002852)
Another lie? But this is so--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000286C)
【Faris】Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000287C)
And now she looks up emphatically.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288C)
And then she clings to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000289C)
【Faris】I... remember nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028AC)
【Rintaro】Remember what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C6)
【Faris】...I remember nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D6)
There was a sense of urgency in her voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E6)
I'm engulfed by that force, unable to respond.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F6)
【Faris】MayQueen+Nyan⑯!

【Faris】Kyouma and Daru-nyan were regular customers nya. And Mayushii worked here too nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002922)
【Rintaro】...Really? You really remember?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002932)
Faris nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000294C)
【Faris】And how Kyouma and Daru talked about the time machine at the store, and how I asked to use it in return for searching for the IBN 5100,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000295C)
【Faris】And how later, Kyouma and Daru-nyan won the argument about how comparing time to a river's flow was weird,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000296C)
【Faris】And how we joined in the "blood oath" so I could become a lab mem,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000297C)
It does feel like those things happened...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000298C)
【Rintaro】And the D-mail? Do you remember the D-mail's contents?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A6)
【Faris】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B6)
Faris lets out a sigh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C6)
She droops her shoulders as if that excitement were a lie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D6)
Don't tell me that's all she remembers?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E6)
Or was she really tricking me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F6)
Both were wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A06)
【Faris】I remember, but... Kyouma, did you say you absolutely needed to cancel it nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A16)
【Rintaro】Correct. I need to correct the past changed by your D-mail--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A30)
【Faris】You can't nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A40)
Faris violently shook her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A50)
And then she sticks to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A60)
The two of us, alone in a dim ingredient storehouse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A70)
Our breath hadn't returned to normal, maybe because we had been running.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A80)
Relief that we had hid ourselves from the enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A90)
Or perhaps both, perhaps neither, but Faris just sticking to me was enough to intensely excite me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA0)
Gh, calm down...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ABA)
【Faris】You can't return it to normal nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ACA)
【Rintaro】Please listen, Faris! Mayuri's life depends on this!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE4)
【Faris】Eh... Mayushii's...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AF4)
【Rintaro】If we don't return the world line to normal; if I don't get the IBN 5100, then Mayuri will die...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B04)
【Rintaro】That might sound stupid, but that, is the truth...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B14)
【Rintaro】So please... I need to send another D-mail and cancel the last one you--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B2E)
【Faris】The wish Faris granted with her D-mail--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B3E)
As if to erase my voice, Faris repeats her words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B4E)
Her eyes are faintly clouded, reflecting the dim light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B5E)
【Faris】What Faris granted--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B6E)
【Faris】...Was to revive Papa who died ten years ago nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B7E)
【Rintaro】--!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B8E)
What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BA8)
【Faris】More simply put... it changed the past where Papa died so he wouldn't die nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BB8)
You mean that gentle, dandy dad... died ten years ago...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC8)
That's consistent with everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BD8)
Faris really remembered after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE8)
Since I know the result, all I have to do now is send the cancellation D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BF8)
But my words won't come out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C08)
Does canceling the D-mail that avoided her dad's death ten years ago,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C18)
Basically mean the same thing as "Kill her revived father again"--?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C9C)
【Rintaro】!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CAC)
I hear the sound of the door opening and rush to block Faris' mouth with my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CC8)
【Viral Attacker A】Is Faris really hiding in here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD8)
【Viral Attacker B】Someone saw two people who looked like them get in here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE8)
Crap...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF8)
Don't tell me we were seen!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D08)
We need to do something here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D18)
If they call their friends, it's curtains for us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF2)
【Rintaro】...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E10)
Shit, not now...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E2E)
The Viral men react to the ringtone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FD6)
【Viral Attacker A】Where are you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FE6)
【Viral Attacker B】So you were here, huh Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FF6)
【Rintaro】Hello--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003012)
【Kurisu】Okabe! Can you hear me!? We called a taxi, but it'll take some time to get there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000302E)
Kurisu, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000303E)
【Rintaro】You exposed us to the pursuers... They're right in front of us...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000304E)
【Viral Attacker A】Hey, come out!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000305E)
【Viral Attacker B】There's no point in hiding!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000307A)
【Kurisu】I see. Then I'll give you an escape method lecture. You haven't left the place you were before, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003096)
The men are approaching our hiding spot. But because the room is dark, it seems they can't tell where we are.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030A6)
I listen carefully to Kurisu's voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030C2)
【Kurisu】Scatter the wheat flour that's in the room and escape. OK?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030DE)
Scatter...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030FA)
【Kurisu】Then switch on the light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003116)
Now I get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003126)
I see, so that's it, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003136)
【Rintaro】Roger. Over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000314C)
And then I see a white flash.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000315C)
The pursuer takes out a balisong with his right hand, opening up the blade with some fancy finger flipping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031A4)
【Faris】!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032D8)
I hurriedly rip open a nearby wheat flour sack and toss its contents out into the air.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032E8)
The scattered white powder shines in the sunlight through the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032F8)
【Viral Attacker A】Gwah, 'the hell's this!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003308)
【Viral Attacker B】I can't see...! Gawch gawch
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003318)
Slipping beside the flustered men, I carry Faris towards the exit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003328)
Right next to the exit, I see the light switch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003338)
I push Faris out first and flip the switch right before shutting the door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033F2)
Right as we get out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003468)
On the other side of the door, a sound like firecrackers resounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003478)
Dust explosion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003492)
A chemical phenomenon used by guys like <DICT>MacDyver</DICT> or %B2SMaster Cheaton%B2E.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034A2)
Now those guys will be preoccupied for a bit, unable to chase us!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034EA)
【Faris】Khohkhoh, khohkhohkhoh
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034FA)
Faris coughs with wheat flour covering her clothes and hair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000350A)
But we don't have time to spare.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000351A)
The taxi still isn't here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000352A)
But it's not like we can wait for it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000353A)
We need to leave here quickly...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035BC)
I press the call end button and push the phone into my pocket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035CC)
But it's too late.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035DC)
They already heard it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035F8)
【Viral Attacker A】Hey, we found you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003608)
【Viral Attacker B】Hehhehhe! You can't escape!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003618)
With brass knuckles in hand, he starts grinning, baring his canines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003628)
We're suddenly driven to the wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003638)
Dammit! Is this it--!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003648)
The moment I started giving up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003690)
【Faris】Ah, ah-! ４℃ got run over by a car there nya-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036A0)
Faris yelled as she pointed out the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B0)
【Viral Attacker A】Wh-what!? ４℃-san!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036CC)
Faris recklessly rushes the bewildered men--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036DC)
Or so I thought, but she slips through them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036EC)
I follow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037D6)
We run down the stairs, almost tumbling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037E6)
【Rintaro】Nice feint, Faris...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038A8)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038B8)
【Viral Attacker C】You're not getting away!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038C8)
【Viral Attacker D】We have you surrounded!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038D8)
Crap...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038E8)
We headed for the lab, but got ambushed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003930)
【Faris】Ah, ahh... ahhhh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003940)
Soon Faris and I are surrounded by the group with the fires of hatred burning in their eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003988)
【４℃】Yo, not letting you run any more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003998)
The crowd parts left and right, and ４℃ steps forward, wearing a hat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039A8)
【４℃】I'll tell you one thing. You bastards can't escape my totally bad black aura.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039C0)
I quickly protect Faris behind my back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039D0)
４℃ pops the knuckles in his fists, showing his white teeth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E0)
【４℃】I always act against the system. This time, my elegant evil story ends in perfect victory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039F0)
【Rintaro】Stop. Don't lay a finger on me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A00)
The only thing I can do to stop faltering is to go into Hououin Kyouma mode.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A10)
【Rintaro】Gh, at this rate, my right arm... will break lose...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A20)
【４℃】Always standing at the front line of the scene is one man. That one man, is the peacock flapping its black wings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A30)
【Rintaro】Gh, gwaaaaah, calm down, right arm of mine...! No, the seal is... coming undone, everyone, run away now...! Or you will all seriously die...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A40)
【４℃】I'll elegantly floor you with my crazy dance. The one chosen by the jet black wings is I.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A50)
【Rintaro】No... my right hand... my right haaaaand... Please, stop, I don't want, to kill any moore--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A6A)
【４℃】Hey, what the hell is he doing...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D6C)
A sound rings through the top of my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D7C)
I've been struck--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D8C)
【Viral Attacker C】４℃, don't let him trick you! He's just a pretentious hipster bullshitter!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D9C)
【Rintaro】Yeah, like you guys can talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DAC)
【Viral Attacker D】Whatever, just beat the shit outta him!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DBC)
【Rintaro】If you say so... prepare yourselves! Releasing restriction si--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D8)
Before I can finish, I'm kicked in the solar plexus. My gastric juices counterflow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040E8)
【Rintaro】Gweh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040F8)
【Faris】Kyouma!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046E8)
He grabs the top of my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046F8)
He knees me repeatedly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004708)
He releases my hair from his violent grasp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004720)
I fall to the ground and start coughing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000503E)
Hard toes sink into my legs, stomach, shoulders, chest, and face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000504E)
４℃'s relentless final blow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000505E)
【４℃】Pff, what did I say? You can't touch this. Extremely cold ice burns--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000506E)
【Rintaro】Like I said, that's not a burn, but frostbite, you dumbass--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000507E)
【４℃】Why you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000595C)
A hard sole strikes my entire body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000596C)
【Faris】Kyouma-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000597C)
My body seemed like nothing but a sensory organ for pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000598C)
I abandoned all thought and just wished for the storm to pass.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000599C)
【Faris】Stop it nya-! Don't hurt Kyouma any more-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059AC)
【４℃】Shut up. Don't order me around. I only listen to the whispers of Gaia--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059BC)
４℃ takes my thumb in both his hands, twisting it in the opposite direction--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059CC)
【Faris】Stop it! Someone, help-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A86)
A sound--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A96)
Resounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AA6)
A thick exhaust note.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AB6)
The honking of a horn.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AC6)
A large car is rushing through this narrow street at a terrific speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AD6)
Everyone screams and scatters to the sides of the road to avoid it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B4C)
The smell of burnt rubber.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B5C)
Tire tracks on the asphault. A limousine breaks down the siege.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B6C)
It suddenly stops right in front of my fallen face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B7C)
The backseat door opens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B8C)
【Faris' Dad】Get inside!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B9C)
【Faris】P-Papa...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C48)
But I can't even stand up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C58)
There's no strength in my entire body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C68)
My vision is hazy too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C78)
And then a slender arm wraps underneath my armpit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C88)
The soft scent of tachibana tickles my nose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005CD0)
【Faris】Kyouma, hang in there nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005CE0)
I roll into the limousine, borrowing Faris' shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DF6)
【４℃】D-dammit! Wait!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E06)
The door shuts, interrupting his shouting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E7C)
The car speeds off like a bullet.
