Daru takes care of Suzuha, returning peace to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001FC)
Kurisu's in the development room, making a call. Probably to her mother in America, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
I sit on the sofa, drinking Dr Pepper, watching TV.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000021C)
What's on is a variety program about the prices of popular meals at high class restaurants.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000022C)
Mayuri sits down next to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000023C)
She peels a banana and begins eating it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000310)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000320)
【Rintaro】Hm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000330)
Mayuri slowly looks around the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000340)
Smiling all the while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000350)
【Mayuri】You know, it seems like we got really busy these past few weeks, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000360)
【Rintaro】Yeah, certainly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000370)
I established the Future Gadget Laboratory at the same time as I entered college to make my debut upon the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000380)
That was around the middle of March this year, which means it's almost been five months.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000390)
Not half a month after it was established, Mayuri started staying here with an ambiguous reason, and became a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A0)
So from then until I finally got Daru to change his mind by telling him the lab's a three minute walk from "MayQueen+Nyan⑯", nobody was in the lab except me and Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B0)
It's originally located in a quiet place just outside of Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C0)
Mayuri's not the type to object to every little thing like Kurisu, nor the type to make dumbass jokes like Daru, so the lab was very peaceful back then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003D0)
With that said, I was comfortable in those calm times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003E0)
Before I realized it, the lab mem count increased to 8.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F0)
They didn't come today, but Lukako visits occasionally, and Faris is a familiar face at "MayQueen+Nyan⑯". But it's gone now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000400)
To someone from Ikebukuro like me, Akiba was a different town at first, but now, it's like a second home town to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041A)
【Mayuri】It's fun, huh♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000042A)
Mayuri also seems happy that there are more people in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000444)
【Mayuri】You know, the lab mems increased to 8, right? Mayushii thinks it's getting a little cramped-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000454)
【Mayuri】First of all, we don't have enough chairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000464)
The sofa in the center of the room sits only two people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000474)
Then there's Daru's personal desk chair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000484)
Those are the only chairs in the lounge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000494)
Though, there are some pipe chairs in the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004AE)
【Mayuri】We need to buy more-. Okarin, do you have money?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BE)
【Rintaro】If I buy chairs, that'll take all my savings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CE)
Then I'd need to start working again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DE)
【Mayuri】Then, Mayushii can give some of her salary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004F8)
【Mayuri】Also, a microwave. If we don't buy a new one, I can't warm up any Juicy Karaage Number One-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000508)
【Rintaro】Ahh, sorry about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000518)
Cutting off Mayuri's karaage supply puts her in a life or death situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000528)
【Rintaro】But Mayuri. If we turn in the Time Leap Machine for a reward, that'll solve all our problems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000542)
【Mayuri】Will it be enough for chairs and a microwave, and to pay the slightly increased rent?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000552)
【Rintaro】It'll be enough. More than enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000056C)
【Mayuri】Is that so-. That's great, Okarin♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000057C)
【Rintaro】Why are you that happy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000596)
【Mayuri】Just look, we've made so many friends.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A6)
【Mayuri】Like Daru-kun, and Chris-chan, and Luka-chan, Suzu-san, Moeka-san, Faris-chan, Manager-san, Nae-chan, et cetera et cetera.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C0)
She squints her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D0)
As if looking to a faraway place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E0)
【Mayuri】But in springtime, Okarin looked so lonely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005FA)
【Mayuri】But now he's fine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060A)
【Mayuri】Even without Mayushii as hostage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000061A)
【Rintaro】What do you--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000062A)
mean by that? I tried to ask, when--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000698)
The sound of an urgent news flash flows from the TV.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A8)
The subtitles read Terrorist Bomb Threat Suspends Yamate, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku Lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000744)
【Suzuha】Terrorist bomb threat?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000754)
【Itaru】Anyway, all those lines lead to Akihabara Station. Mayu-shi, you can't go home, can you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085C)
【Mayuri】That's right-. I need to call home-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086C)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087C)
Terrorist bomb...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088C)
I don't know why, but I've got a bad feeling about this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089C)
There's the fact that only the lines passing through Akihabara are suspended, as if that were the target.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AC)
Wait, maybe that's actually a hint.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BC)
As to the location of the terrorist bomb threat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008CC)
Akihabara?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DC)
It feels like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E4)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro, let me ask you something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F4)
【Suzuha】Have you completed the Time Leap Machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A04)
【Rintaro】Huh? Yeah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1E)
【Suzuha】I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A38)
【Suzuha】I remember I've got something to do, so I'm going out a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A54)
Suzuha bluntly says so and quickly leaves the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9C)
【Kurisu】What's with her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAC)
Suzuha's suspicious actions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABC)
Are they related to the terrorist bomb threat?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACC)
Why did she just ask if the Time Leap Machine was complete?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADC)
Something crosses my mind--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEC)
The two threat mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C36)
You're being watched.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7E)
You know too much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8E)
Who sent those?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9E)
Not just that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBA)
Almost like a flashback.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCA)
Several things that I had turned a blind eye to now cause anxiety to run through my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E30)
SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDA)
LHC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F84)
Jellyman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102E)
Z Program.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D8)
Top secret national information from France, England, and Holland.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001182)
Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AE)
Black suits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CA)
Council of 300.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E6)
Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F6)
What Kurisu said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DE)
【Kurisu】We... may have made something outrageous...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001338)
By themselves, I could overlook each of these things by telling myself It'll probably be okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001348)
But now that I reconsider them all as points on one line,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001358)
All I can think is that we've stepped on an outrageous landmine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F6)
Anxiety won't leave my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001406)
As if a cold hand had its grip around my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001416)
Choking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001426)
Even though it should be humid, my body shivers from the cold.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001436)
Shouldn't we run away?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001446)
But we can't use the train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001456)
What about the subway?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001466)
Or a bus, or taxi?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001476)
Nobody's saying anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001486)
Nobody's doing anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001496)
What should we do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F6)
A soft feeling on my fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CA)
When I look, Mayuri firmly grasps my hand with anxiety on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DA)
It's okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EA)
I'm thinking too much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FA)
It's just a coincidence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160A)
Let's relinquish the Time Leap Machine tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161A)
We can forget about everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162A)
I didn't see anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163A)
We're not seeing anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164A)
I don't need money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165A)
As long as I can forget about today and welcome tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
It's okay, right...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167A)
Anxiety doesn't disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171A)
I look over Mayuri's head to the lab's entrance-- to the door's lock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172A)
The lock's open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173A)
Anyone could come in if they wanted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174A)
I hear a fire-engine's siren from outside the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175A)
Akiba is visibly in an uproar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176A)
And yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177A)
It's so silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178A)
Inside the lab, and outside the lab, it's so silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179A)
I firmly grip back Mayuri's warm, slender fingers--
<FILEEND52>
