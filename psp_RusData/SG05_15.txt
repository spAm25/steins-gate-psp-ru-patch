#WRITE(PTR, $000007C8)
After that, nobody tried to touch the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D8)
It might blow your memories into the past just by touching it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E8)
That's how we felt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F8)
Though it's absurd, of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000808)
I might become humanity's first time leaper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000818)
That curiosity couldn't kill the fear of the unknown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000828)
Just how should we react to that fear--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000838)
Before we knew it, we talked about having a small celebration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000848)
We kinda feel the need to let loose after working all night.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000858)
Nobody opposed the notion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A98)
I have Daru order pizza while Kurisu and I go out shopping for snacks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA8)
Akiba has a severe lack of supermarkets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
It's the same even after the moe shops disappeared and turned the town retro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC8)
After we finish shopping, Kurisu and I walk along the evening Akiba streets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B10)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B20)
Kurisu's been walking next to me for a while, looking like she wants to say something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B30)
She keeps stealing glances at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B40)
【Rintaro】Dissatisfied?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5A)
【Kurisu】Dissatisfied?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6A)
Doesn't look like she expected that word from me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7A)
Finally, she faces this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8A)
【Rintaro】Dissatisfied that we're not experimenting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA4)
【Kurisu】No way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB4)
【Kurisu】"Humans are temporal beings".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC4)
【Kurisu】That's a Heidegger quote.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD4)
【Kurisu】When you decided we won't experiment, I was actually relieved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE4)
【Kurisu】If nobody came to stop me, then I might not have been able to stop myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF4)
【Kurisu】Thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C04)
Oh, ohh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C14)
It's a rare, admirable gratitude.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C24)
Does she have a fever?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C74)
Kurisu twitches when I put my hand to her forehead to check.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C84)
【Kurisu】Hey, what are you doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C94)
【Rintaro】I thought you might have a fever since you're saying such assistant-like words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE4)
I drop my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF4)
【Kurisu】It's not like I'm grateful for you or anything, okay!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D04)
Kurisu attracts the attention of all the surrounding pedestrians with that line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1E)
Kurisu hangs her blushing head once she notices.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2E)
If Daru were here, he'd probably get all excited and say A real tsundere ftw!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D48)
【Kurisu】Anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF4)
Kurisu clears her throat, returning to her usual sour face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E98)
【Kurisu】That thanks was just a formality. Don't get me wrong, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3C)
【Rintaro】Like hell I'd get you wrong. 'Cause I've only done what was natural.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE0)
【Rintaro】For as Lab Member 001 and founder of the lab, I, Hououin Kyouma, place highest priority on protecting the welfare of my lab mems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001084)
【Rintaro】So I have no need for your thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001128)
【Kurisu】And yet you say things like visiting chaos upon the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CC)
【Rintaro】My lab mems are my allies, and the world is my enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127A)
【Kurisu】I'm speechless. You're too self-righteous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131E)
【Rintaro】Speechless, yet you're speaking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CC)
【Kurisu】Don't be a grammar Nazi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001470)
It's mysterious if you think about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001514)
It's still just been two weeks since Kurisu and I met.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
And yet it's become normal for her to be next to me as a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165C)
Though we may have been shackled together when we made that outrageous object.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001700)
This genius girl's wealth of knowledge sure is wonderful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A4)
I'd like her to stay at the lab by all means, but she said she's going to return to America this month. It's already the 13th, so I wonder when she plans to return.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001852)
【Kurisu】Oh yeah, I forgot to get a plane ticket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F6)
That's how she answered when I asked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199A)
【Kurisu】I got too caught up in improving the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3E)
【Rintaro】If we publicly reveal the Time Leap Machine, it'll put the world in an uproar. We also need to prosecute SERN. You'll be unable to go back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF4)
【Kurisu】Ah, I see. I need to call Mama in case that happens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B10)
Looks like things are gong to get busy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B20)
Naturally, I want Kurisu to stay with us to the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C68)
A little bit after we return to the lab, Mayuri gets back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB4)
【Mayuri】Tutturu-♪ I'm back-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EDA)
Seems Mayuri went to Lukako's.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF2)
Our <DICT>development council</DICT> starts, with Suzuha also participating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002010)
Daru ordered three pizzas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002020)
We also lined up all the snacks we bought on the table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002030)
It's the same scene as the party we had to cheer up Suzuha a few days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002040)
It seems like Mayuri wanted to decorate the room, but since everyone's tired, I dismissed it as unnecessary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002088)
Seems like Suzuha safely secured her sweater from Manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002098)
【Suzuha】Man-, that was terrible. I got stuck with acting like an exhibitionist for an entire day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B4)
The Braun Tube Workshop's already closed for today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C4)
I checked with Suzuha to make sure the 42in Braun tube TV's off, so there's no need to fear failure from the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D4)
Upon hearing that, I take a big sigh and free my body from the stress.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E4)
Then I notice that I've been nervous these five hours since the Time Leap Machine's been complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002184)
Even when we started the development council, Kurisu didn't touch the topic of the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002194)
That topic is taboo in this party. It's become that sort of atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
【Rintaro】Daru, why did you order the exact same pizza as before!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021EC)
I had opened the delivered pizza boxes to find the exact same ones as for Suzuha's party.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021FC)
【Itaru】Because, I like it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000220C)
Naturally, I'm shocked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
【Mayuri】Okarin, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000226E)
【Mayuri】I called Faris-chan and Luka-chan too, but they said they couldn't join today-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000227E)
【Rintaro】I see. Did they have things to do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002298)
【Mayuri】Faris-chan has a RaiNet tournament today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B2)
【Itaru】Crap, I should've cheered her on! How careless of me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C2)
【Mayuri】And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002312)
【Kurisu】Maybe she thinks you'll make her wear a costume if she comes here again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002322)
【Rintaro】The cosplay stuff? You still haven't convinced her yet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002332)
Then what was the point in completing the costume?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234C)
【Mayuri】She said it was embarrassing. Even though "Cute is Justice"-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002366)
【Kurisu】"Cute is Justice"... that phrase is getting popular.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002380)
【Mayuri】Chris-chan, you're cute too-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000239A)
【Kurisu】Hah? Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023AA)
Kurisu's surprised at the sudden turn of events.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023BA)
Mayuri starts teasing the blushing Kurisu like a nasty old drunkard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023CA)
Figuratively speaking, of course, since there's no alcohol at this party.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E4)
【Mayuri】Heyhey, wanna go to this coming ComiMa-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F4)
【Mayuri】I can't make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for Chris-chan too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000240E)
【Kurisu】Me, cosplay...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000241E)
Kurisu makes a difficult face, and then murmurs--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002438)
【Kurisu】I'm sorta interested.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002448)
Bitch, you didn't look interested at all before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002458)
【Kurisu】Ah, but I refuse to do it in public, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002472)
【Mayuri】It's okay to just wear it-. But you know, eventually, you'll want everyone to see. The cosplay demon compels you-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002482)
Demon...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000249C)
【Mayuri】That reminds me. Chris-chan, you're always wearing that cute uniform, huh-. But was there a uniform like this in metro Tokyo-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B6)
【Kurisu】Ah, this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C6)
Kurisu pulls up her necktie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024DE)
【Kurisu】For just two weeks, I did something like an abroad study at <DICT>Ayamein</DICT>, and so I modeled this after their uniform.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F8)
【Mayuri】Ah-, so it was Ayamein-. Their uniform is originally cute huh-. But Chris-chan's modeling sense might be really good~♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002508)
【Mayuri】Tomorrow, I'll bring the costume, okay? Then will you try it on-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002522)
【Kurisu】Yeah. Okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002532)
Looks like Kurisu approves of the message of Cute is Justice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002582)
【Itaru】When's the photo session?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259C)
【Kurisu】And of course, Hashida's always working hard on the pervert road, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025AC)
【Itaru】Come on, it's Blood Tune's Seira, right!? She's got panmoro going on, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025BC)
【Kurisu】Panmoro?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D6)
【Itaru】It means you can see MORe O' her PANties.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F0)
【Kurisu】Eh, no way...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002640)
【Mayuri】It's okay-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002650)
【Mayuri】Chris-chan might not know this, but last year, this phrase was really popular.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000266A)
【Mayuri】"They're not panties so it's not embarrassing!".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002684)
【Kurisu】No, no, it-it's embarrassing, right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002694)
【Mayuri】Absolutely wear it, okay? Absolutely-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026AA)
【Suzuha】Maybe you should just stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000278A)
Forcing her way through with a sharp voice is Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000279A)
She scowls at Kurisu like usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027AA)
The formerly fun atmosphere freezes in an instant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000280E)
【Suzuha】If you believe in Makise Kurisu, you'll get into trouble.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000281E)
【Kurisu】What do you mean by that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000282E)
And there's also my usual assistant, Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000283E)
Naturally, she shows no signs of running from the fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000284E)
Sparks begin to fly between the two girls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000285E)
【Kurisu】I've been thinking for a while, but, have I done anything to you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000286E)
【Suzuha】Nothing directly. But I know everything you've done.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000287E)
【Kurisu】What do mean everything I've done? I've done nothing to be guilty of.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288E)
【Suzuha】Sure thing. But I know. I know your true nature.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000289E)
【Kurisu】Hmm, amazing. You can peek into my heart? That's a ground-breaking invention, so please, show me by all means.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028AE)
【Suzuha】There is no device. If I'm forced to say, then it's a prediction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028BE)
【Kurisu】So basically, you're all talk, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028CE)
【Suzuha】But it's the "truth".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028DE)
We've got a situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028EE)
【Mayuri】Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FE)
Mayuri clings to me with teary eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290E)
【Mayuri】Stop them-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291E)
【Rintaro】Hehehe, seems like the only one who can bring peace in this situation is I, Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292E)
I step between them, grab their shoulders and separate them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029BE)
【Rintaro】Break it up you two! For I, Hououin Kyouma, shall decide this dispute!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029CE)
They glare at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029DE)
Though flinching, I endure it without exposing my weakness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029EE)
First, I focus on Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA2)
【Rintaro】Assistant, I don't remember raising you to be like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB2)
【Kurisu】I don't remember you raising me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC2)
【Rintaro】Let me tell you the most important thing to be a mad scientist. Namely, "hot on the outside, cold on the inside"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AD2)
【Kurisu】I didn't ask. I don't want to be one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE2)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B60)
Next, I switch focus to Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C14)
【Rintaro】O Warrior, you should be fighting "Ragnarok" against SERN, not her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C24)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro, I've warned you, haven't I? To be careful of Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C34)
【Rintaro】Hey
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C44)
You're going to talk about that here, now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C54)
【Kurisu】Hehhh... What's this about, Okabe?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD2)
I wanted to run away from their cold glances staring daggers at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE2)
But Mayuri's watching anxiously. I need to fulfill her request somehow or another!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF2)
【Rintaro】Fuuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D02)
【Rintaro】Neither of you guys wants to pull back. Then fight each other to your heart's content. Then after that, share a manly handshake by the river and let friendship blossom!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D12)
【Rintaro】But, in the future, when you go out into the public, just be aware of this one thing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D22)
【Rintaro】You two just can't read the atmosphere!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D3A)
【Kurisu&Suzuha (K)】Shut up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D4A)
【Kurisu&Suzuha (S)】Shut up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D5E)
Getting told by both of them at the same time sends chills down my spine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D6E)
I endure by gripping my right wrist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D7E)
【Rintaro】Gwahh... now, of all times...! Calm down, right hand of mine...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DDC)
Then, I take a right about-face and head back to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E70)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, I'm sorry, at his rate, I'll hurt those two, so... I'll leave the rest to you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E8A)
【Mayuri】Geez--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E9A)
Mayuri puffs her cheeks out to contain her anger, and intervenes in my place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EB4)
【Mayuri】Listen you two-. Mayushii doesn't like it when you fight. Let's all get along-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EC4)
Then, the two of them reluctantly comply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ED4)
As expected of the oil to our group's gears. It's because Mayuri's a lab mem that things don't go crazy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE4)
The throbbing in my right arm dissipates.
