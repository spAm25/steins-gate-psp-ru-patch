#WRITE(PTR, $000002A4)
【Mayuri】Okari-n♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000380)
Coming out of the ticket gate, Mayuri leisurely walks up to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000424)
【Mayuri】Tutturu-♪ I didn't think you'd actually come all the way to the station to pick me up-. Mayushii's surprised.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C8)
【Rintaro】It would be bad if my "hostage" got away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000056C)
【Mayuri】Yeah, it would be bad. So, Mayushii's really happy. Ehhehe-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000610)
I don't quite understand, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B4)
Mayuri gives a carefree smile, walking ahead of me, almost skipping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000762)
【Mayuri】So, what's that bag you're holding?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000806)
【Rintaro】...Mister Braun gave it to me. It's an Upart that can measure the numerical values of world lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B4)
【Mayuri】Hmm, seems amazing, huh-. But, what are "numerical values of world lines"-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000958)
I smile wryly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0E)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, you really are a dummy, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A26)
Why did I do this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A36)
After I left Manager's house, I called Mayuri to ask when she's coming to Akiba, and then came to the station to pick her up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A46)
Anxiety still smoulders at the bottom of my heart--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A56)
Yesterday-- the night of Friday the 13th. We somehow managed to survive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A76)
While that may be true, that doesn't mean our safety is guaranteed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A86)
For example-- the possibility that Moeka will attack now, daytime on the 14th, isn't zero.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A96)
I might just be over-protective. But still.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA6)
If I let my guard down, the scene of Mayuri's death still flashes back into my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB6)
I don't ever want to see that scene again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B76)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, I'm just talking hypothetically, but do you think it would be better if you didn't come to Akiba until ComiMa ends?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1A)
I made such a proposal, but she didn't answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBE)
Wanting to know what's wrong, I look to the side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D62)
【Rintaro】Wait, where is she!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
I look around in a rush and see her wandering off to a newly opened shaved ice store.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBC)
Tch. That careless girl...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102C)
【Kurisu】Okabe's a devoted type, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
Kurisu, completely settled into the lab, starts talking with a sour look on her face and an iced coffee in her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
【Rintaro】How so?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
I was on @channel, gathering information on the IBN 5100, but I let go of the mouse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106C)
I couldn't find the IBN 5100. I went to Yanabayashi Shrine this morning, but contrary to my expectations, the retro PC wasn't there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107C)
The thing that Suzuha had promised she would entrust to us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108C)
Her present from 1975.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109C)
Without it, we can't hack into SERN's database, meaning we can't achieve Divergence over 1％.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B6)
【Kurisu】You're starting to treat Mayuri like a princess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C6)
【Kurisu】Today you went to the station to greet her, you poison tasted her lunch, and you even walked here hand in hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000110E)
【Mayuri】You know, Okarin loves Mayushii, doesn't he? Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111E)
So she talked...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000112E)
Mayuri said so carefree, stuffing her cheeks with takoyaki.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000113E)
I'm pretty sure she's not smiling happily because of my love, but because of the takoyaki's deliciousness. Anyway, she's talking like it doesn't involve her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000114E)
I mean, don't tell Kurisu...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001168)
【Kurisu】So, honestly, what is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001178)
【Rintaro】What's what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001188)
【Kurisu】I've been wondering. Are you two going out?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001198)
【Rintaro】Does it look like it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B2)
【Kurisu】Eh, uh, that's, umm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C2)
Just what sort of delusion did this girl have?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D2)
【Mayuri】You know, Okarin and Mayushii have been friends since we were little-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011EC)
【Mayuri】Uu ou, Mwawoohii's weeally hwawy nawo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011FC)
【Rintaro】Don't talk while eating. It's improper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001210)
【Kurisu】So, you're not going out?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000122A)
 W-well, I don't think anyone would go out with someone like Okabe, so that's obvious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123E)
【Rintaro】Pff, Christina. I'm disappointed in you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001258)
【Kurisu】Haah? What's that all of a sudden?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
【Rintaro】I noticed. I have noticed. Your true nature. You're nothing but a mainstream woman who really gets into love talks...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001278)
【Rintaro】You're at the age where you like love talks and reading love stories, aren't you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001288)
【Rintaro】Absurd! Neither I, Hououin Kyouma, nor our lab, wish for someone whose head is filled with such a flower garden!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001298)
It feels nostalgic, but strange for me to be spewing such pretentious hipster bullshit after so long.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A8)
It feels a little awkward to say lines like these.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B8)
Guh, can I no longer return to those pure days...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D2)
【Kurisu】Just what are you trying to say, you pretentious, (self-proclaimed) mad scientist?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E2)
It's been so long since I've had a useless conversation with Kurisu like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F2)
I suddenly feel lonely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001302)
When I was driven into a corner, unable to save Mayuri, I sought help from this genius girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001312)
And then she encouraged me, supported me, all the while using a sever manner of speech.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001322)
That fact completely disappeared the same way Suzuha's memories did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001332)
--Thank you for encouraging me back then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001342)
I express secret gratitude in my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D4)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E4)
I finish typing on the X68000's keyboard and sigh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F4)
I stare at the Divergence Meter placed on the side shelf.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001540)
Its number: 0.409431％.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001550)
What that meant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001650)
【Suzuha】The world's structure is like a 'twisted thread'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001660)
【Suzuha】Many possible world lines are in superposition, branching out infinitely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CC)
【Suzuha】When the meter surpasses 1％, you will have reached the β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001738)
【Suzuha】Outside the range of Attractor Field α-- If you reach the β World Line... the converging 'result' will also change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A4)
【Suzuha】That's right. As long as you break through 1％... you can save Shiina Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FE)
Then, conversely--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180E)
Since I haven't broken 1％, does that mean Mayuri isn't saved?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181E)
Is the world converging to the same "result"-- that is, Mayuri's death?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182E)
That can't be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183E)
That shouldn't be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000184E)
I mean, nothing happened yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185E)
Mayuri's alive, here, safe and sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186E)
So nothing will happen. Nothing should happen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187E)
I believed that, but the dark doubt deep within my heart is slowly swelling today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000188E)
My brain can't seem to think about anything else now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189E)
No matter how much I stare at it, the meter's number won't move a smidgen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AE)
So far, the only times Reading Steiner has activated are the times we sent past-changing D-mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194E)
What is it like... in the case of time leaping?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195E)
The vertigo I feel when I time leap might be an adverse effect of my "Reading Steiner" ability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196E)
Or possibly, it might be caused by my nerves pulsating when my brain is forced to remember future memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197E)
I can't explain everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198E)
In any case, I'm perfectly prepared for the worst case scenario.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199E)
I've already set the Time Leap machine's timer to send my memories to my phone three hours into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AE)
And with Daru's help, I bought a remote for the 42in Braun tube TV downstairs from a junk shop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019BE)
When we were experimenting with the Microwave Ophone earlier, it made a hole in the floor, but that's actually useful. Instead of filling the hole, I made it bigger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019CE)
The 42in Braun tube TV was right underneath the hole.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DE)
So if I point the remote to the hole and press the power button, it turns on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7E)
So if things suddenly go bad, I can time leap immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A8E)
And I also have Future Gadget No.4: Monad Snake on hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD6)
【Kurisu】Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE6)
Kurisu enters the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF6)
【Kurisu】Didn't you say we weren't going to do Time Leap Machine experiments?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B06)
【Rintaro】This is just in case.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B20)
【Kurisu】In case what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B30)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B40)
I don't want to answer that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B50)
I keep praying that my fears will end unfounded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B60)
--It's okay. Everything should be okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B70)
They didn't attack yesterday, so nothing should happen today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B80)
At the very least, we're past the crisis of Mayuri's life.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B90)
But I still can't help but pray.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA0)
Please let everything be safe. Please don't let anything happen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CBC)
My prayers were--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CCC)
Unanswered.
<FILEEND7E>
