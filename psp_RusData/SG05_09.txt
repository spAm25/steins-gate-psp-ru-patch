Since it's night, we tried to activate the Microwave Ophone (Temp) again, but the result was no different. The discharge phenomenon still won't occur.

【Mayuri】Haww...

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9A)
Mayuri yawns a little while making her costume with her sewing machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B48)
After delivering her costume to the cosplayer, Fubuki-chan, she came here in the evening and kept working since.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEC)
Now that I think about it, she usually goes back home at 7 or 8, but today, she's working hard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C90)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, you need to go home soon or you'll be late. Your parents will worry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D34)
【Mayuri】Mm, it's okay-. Actually, Mayushii's staying here overnight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD8)
【Rintaro】...Eh, really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E7C)
She's never done that before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F20)
【Mayuri】Yup. I already told my father and mother-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC4)
【Rintaro】You staying so you can work?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001072)
【Mayuri】If I don't, I won't make it in time for ComiMa-. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001116)
【Rintaro】Your parents sure are lenient.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BA)
I've met Mayuri's parents many times. They're as optimistic as Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000125E)
But still, I don't think they'd like their underage daughter to stay overnight in such a dirty lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001302)
【Rintaro】I, Hououin Kyouma, sure am popular, huh... No, wait, words like "popular" make me want to puke... So no, that's not it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A6)
【Rintaro】I see! Mayuri's parents are so afraid of me that they'd let me take their daughter hosta--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000144A)
【Kurisu】Reported.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EE)
Kurisu calls out from the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001592)
Looks like she was listening while tinkering with the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167A)
【Kurisu】What'll you do when told that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171E)
【Rintaro】If you're going to betray me, then I'll summon fire from my right arm, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CC)
【Kurisu】Yeah, yeah, whatever, pretentious hipster bullshit, whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187A)
【Mayuri】Well, since I told them that Chris-chan is with us, my father and mother said it's okay in that case-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001928)
【Kurisu】So basically, you mean I'm going to stay too?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D6)
【Mayuri】Yupperdoodles♪ I mean, isn't it tough to work on Microwave Ophone-chan's improvements-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A84)
【Kurisu】Well, yeah, but... It's depressing to stay in this lab overnight. Because of a certain somebody.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B28)
【Rintaro】Environment is a key factor, Christina. Since this is a place of pure research, you can concentrate unexpectedly well here. Sauce is me, Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BCC)
【Rintaro】Also, don't be surprised. This lab is equipped with brain function stimulation systems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C70)
【Rintaro】Basically, my genius, my boldness, and my delicate conception of inventions were all brought into being by lodging here every night!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1E)
【Kurisu】These brain function stimulation systems of yours, what exactly do they emit?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC2)
【Rintaro】Don't talk like such a factory environmentalist, The Zombie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E70)
【Mayuri】Ah, Mayushii knows. It's probably gotta be that, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F20)
Kurisu comes out of the development room to confirm what Mayuri's pointing at.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FFC)
【Kurisu】This... air freshener?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A4)
【Mayuri】He said it's a smartifying air freshener-. Okarin said he bought it at "Akibaoo".
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020BE)
 When was that-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002166)
【Rintaro】...About half a year ago. It was on sale at 500 yen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002218)
【Kurisu】Okabe, the way you said it makes it seem you don't really believe in it, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022BC)
【Kurisu】Furthermore, the medicine inside is empty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002360)
When I tried to buy the medicine replacement packs at Akibaoo, they stopped selling them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002408)
【Kurisu】Well, whatever. I was planning to stay either way.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002422)
 I'll join you, Mayuri-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D4)
【Mayuri】Really? That's great-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002582)
【Kurisu】On one condition: if Okabe leaves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002626)
【Rintaro】Leave, you say? I basically live here! This lab was the promised land granted unto me by Steins;Gate's choice. It's the dwelling place of my soul!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D4)
【Kurisu】Two girls are staying here overnight, so filthy boys need to show respect. Your house isn't even far from here, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002782)
【Mayuri】Actually, Okarin lives near Mayushii, in Ikebukuro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002842)
【Kurisu】Why, that's less than 30 minutes by train. Anyway, it's not worth it to get you to help overnight today, so just go home like a good boy, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000285A)
【Rintaro】But I refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002874)
【Kurisu】No way, you plan to molest us!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002884)
【Rintaro】Shut up, you bitch with a birthmarked butt!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000289E)
【Kurisu】I don't have one! You know, you said that before, but just when did you check my butt...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028AE)
【Rintaro】I'm not so thoughtless that I'd leave two younger girls here all alone. Minors need guardians!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C8)
【Mayuri】But Okarin's a minor too, ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D8)
【Rintaro】I'll be an adult in less than one and a half years. That means that by Steins;Gate's choice, I am an adult.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F2)
【Kurisu】No, that means you're a minor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290C)
【Mayuri】Chris-chan, Chris-chan. You know, Mayushii doesn't think that Okarin's the sort of bad guy who'd molest us-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291C)
【Mayuri】I mean, he's been with Mayushii for more than ten years, and he hasn't molested me once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002936)
【Kurisu】But he took you "hostage", didn't he?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002950)
【Mayuri】Yup♪ Well, actually, I still am a "hostage"-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000296A)
【Kurisu】We should force him out of the room, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000297A)
【Rintaro】Hmm-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000298A)
I take a deep breath while placing my hand to my brow and shaking my head lightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000299A)
【Rintaro】Don't disappoint me so, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B8)
【Rintaro】This lab is a sanctuary of scientific study. If you're going to speak of such vulgarities, then I'll have to ask you to please leave, Birthmark!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C8)
When I strictly point this out, Kurisu seems convinced.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E4)
She gives me an Okay, okay gesture, spreading both hands, and returns to the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F4)
【Rintaro】I see. So Christina really does have a birthmark on her bu--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A42)
【Kurisu】Do not!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B60)
About an hour later, after she had begun to concentrate on work, I went to a convenience store to buy dinner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B70)
In the end, I didn't see Daru all day today. Though, he did say he had a part time job.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B80)
Whatever job he has is a mystery to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B90)
Probably something utilizing his Supah Hakah skill.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BA0)
It's best if he's not on the wrong side of the law, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BB0)
While taking my evening stroll, I skim @channel's occult board on my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC0)
Lately, Titor hasn't made an appearance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BD0)
When was his last appearance again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE0)
It's almost been a week.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BF0)
I've kept my distance from him ever since he said You might be the messiah when he contacted me in his last personal mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C00)
And at the same time, Titor stopped posting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C10)
Just about all of @chan's denizens are posting slander against Titor. The majority opinion is he ran away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C20)
I wonder where Titor went.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C30)
I tried mailing him at his supposed personal address, but he hasn't replied.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C40)
Actually, I'm worried about this 'disappearance' since I think that Titor might be Suzuha's father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C50)
I want to contact him somehow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF2)
As I think that, a mail arrives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D10)
No sender name. The address is... one I've seen once before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D2E)
...I've got a bad feeling about this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D4C)
I pause and take a look around. Then I take a gulp and open the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030BC)
It feels as if a cold hand stroked my spine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000313A)
I embrace my myself to brace myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003152)
I quickly delete the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003162)
It came again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000317E)
Danger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000318E)
I feel endangered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000319E)
This is a warning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031AE)
From the Organization?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031BE)
From SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031CE)
Did SERN find out...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031DE)
Should I report it to the police?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031EE)
I can't, I just deleted the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031FE)
And the police probably won't take action due to just two threat-like mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000320E)
When the first mail came, I didn't tell anyone, but should I consult someone after all?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000321E)
But who is that someone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000322E)
Not those two girls. I can't worry them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000323E)
Those two girls are younger than I.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000324E)
Then, Moeka?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000325E)
No. She once was a lab mem, but she's been weird lately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000326E)
Even if I consult her in that state, I won't get an answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000327E)
Suzuha... is probably concentrating on her father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000328E)
I guess I can only consult Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000329E)
I need to make it clear whether or not SERN found out about our hacking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032AE)
I wonder how SERN is acting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032BE)
They're not going to just suddenly kill us, right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032CE)
I wanted to be optimistic, but my walk back to the lab spontaneously became a sprint back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003442)
I rush into the lab a little out of breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003452)
I lock the entrance door behind me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003462)
Then I finally breathe easily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003472)
But I suddenly feel something out of place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003482)
Mayuri and Kurisu should be here, but they're not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003492)
Did they go home?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034A2)
But their bags are still here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034B2)
The lights are still on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034C2)
The lock...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034D2)
When I entered just now, the door was unlocked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034E2)
That's something to worry about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034F2)
I shiver at the thought of that last mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003502)
Don't tell me those two were... kidnapped!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003512)
By whom?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003522)
By the Organization?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003532)
Or by SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000354E)
And then I hear a strange noise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000355E)
This sound is... the shower?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000356E)
The lab is furnished with a shower room inside the dressing room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000357E)
Having a shower room instead of a bathroom reeks of poverty. Furthermore, it's such a narrow space, it's one person use only.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000358E)
Then I hear the sound of water flowing from the shower.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003640)
I recall a scene from Hitchcock's famous movie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003650)
Don't tell me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036BE)
Fresh blood, mixing into the water and flowing into the drain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036CE)
The corpses of two girls, sprawled out naked--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037E4)
With that imagination, I hurriedly open up the door to the shower room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000380C)
【Rintaro】Hey! Are you okay!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003932)
【Kurisu】Hey, kyaaah! Okabe, why are you coming in!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003942)
【Mayuri】Hyah, Okarin, it's not good to peek-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003952)
Inside the steam, I saw the wet naked bodies of the two girls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AA4)
Mayuri's squatting down,
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ABC)
 while Kurisu bashfully twists her body, desperately trying to hide her precious spots.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AE2)
I wonder if their faces are turning red because they're showering or because of something else...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BA6)
【Rintaro】Whew, you startled me. So you weren't murdered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BB6)
I calmly wipe the cold sweat off my brow and take a deep breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BC6)
【Rintaro】Don't scare me like that. I mean, you made me worry by using this narrow shower room together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BD6)
And then I felt killing intent burn in Kurisu's eyes behind her wet hair--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BEC)
【Kurisu】Just get out, you PERVERT!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BFC)
【Rintaro】Whoooah!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D12)
When she starts to throw soap straight at my face, I desperately take refuge in the dressing room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E44)
Gh, well, that was clearly all my fault.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E54)
【Mayuri】Doing that made Mayushii sad and embarrassed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E64)
【Kurisu】You better remember this! I-I-I won't forgive you, I won't ever forgive you, okay!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E74)
Dammit, that was just a small, accidental misunderstanding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E84)
But in the first place, before I left, I purposefully looked at the two showering. That was wrong of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E94)
Kurisu and Mayuri were defenseless if they weren't being cautious about my existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EA4)
Geez. It's good that it was me, but it would've been bad if the enemy came.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EB4)
It's going to be a problem if they're this naive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F36)
...By the way, I couldn't find a birthmark on Kurisu's butt, obviously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004060)
...Anyway, weren't they showering for an awfully long time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004070)
Looking at the clock, it's already been more than 15 minutes since I got back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004080)
If those two started using the shower when I left, then that's more like a long bath than a long shower.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004090)
And now, I can hear their laughing voices from the shower room even though they were yelling at me for peeking just earlier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040A0)
They really seem like they're enjoying themselves...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B0)
They get along almost like sisters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004162)
<LINE>
<LINE>
"Wah-, Chris-chan, you're so stylish--"
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004172)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>
%t120"But Mayuri, your breasts sure are big. I'm jealous."
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041A2)
They're having a conversation like that as they touch each other's bodies, right-!? Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004214)
I'm proud of my brain's ability to splendidly reproduce the sight of their naked bodies as I remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004224)
Their wet hair. Drops of water beading off their skin. The bulges of their chests. The conveniently placed steam that hid all of that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000427C)
I put my phone to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000428C)
【Rintaro】...It's me. Things are getting a little dangerous. I, the mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, have suffered a strike from the sisters: the birthmark girl and the optimistic girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000429C)
【Rintaro】...Yeah, this is the highest class offensive ability I have experienced so far. I have come to realize that defenselessness itself is the strongest offense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042AC)
【Rintaro】Take those girls down... you say? Like hell I can do that. Those girls are being manipulated by those guys... but they're my comrade, and my childhood friend nonetheless...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042BC)
【Rintaro】...No matter what? I need to take them down no matter what? Gh, in that case, this is the only time I'll resent Steins;Gate's choice, you know...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042CC)
【Rintaro】El... Psy... Congroo...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042E2)
I wring out a murmur and put away my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042F2)
Maybe I'll head out into the night wind a little...
