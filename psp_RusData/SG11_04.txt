I'm dragged out of the time machine.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000894)
I just crouch there, unable to stand.

【Itaru】Woah, you're already back! It hasn't even been a minute.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000924)
【Mayuri】...Okarin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000974)
【Mayuri】Okarin!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000984)
Mayuri rushes over to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000994)
I peek at her concerned face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A4)
But now, even that concern is annoying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B4)
--Please don't talk to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C4)
--Please let me be alone.

【Itaru】Hey, Okarin, you're all bloody! What happened!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A54)
【Suzuha】Dad, get a towel and some water, also some clothes! Get them now!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A64)
【Itaru】Eh? Eh? Please, explain what's going on!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A74)
【Suzuha】Just go already!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8E)
【Itaru】Oh, okay!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0C)
Daru rushes back inside the building.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1C)
【Mayuri】Okarin, are you okay...? Hang in there... don't die...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6E)
【Suzuha】It's okay. It's not like he's injured.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7E)
Stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8E)
Don't care about me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9E)
Please leave me alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAE)
Save Kurisu? Please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBE)
Far from saving her, I took away her life with my own hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7C)
Here, three weeks ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8A)
I killed her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9A)
I murdered her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFE)
【Rintaro】It was useless... anything I do, useless...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0E)
【Rintaro】Ha, haha... Everything has already been decided...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1E)
【Rintaro】The same... as with Mayuri, the same...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2E)
【Rintaro】No matter how much I struggle... the result will be the same...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3E)
Since we have a time machine, shouldn't I time travel once more?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4E)
No, it's not that simple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E5E)
Just like what happened with Mayuri, no matter how many times I retry, it will all converge to the result Kurisu dies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E6E)
Even if I acted prudently that time and threw away the knife, Kurisu would die for some other reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F24)
Will Nakabachi kill her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F34)
Will I kill her with something other than the knife?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F44)
Will she bang her head on a wall and die of an accident?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA8)
The means don't matter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB8)
The ends will always be the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC8)
Whether I time leap or time travel, I can't change the result by going back to the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD8)
We could possibly change the past by changing the divergence and going to another attractor field. But I don't know how to control that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE8)
Changing the past via D-mail is pure luck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF8)
There's no way to aim.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001008)
So it's a waste.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001018)
Even if I try every means at my disposal, it's all meaningless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001028)
【Rintaro】It's useless... It's all useless... Every single thing is useless...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001038)
【Rintaro】I can't save Kurisu after all... Ha, haha, hahaha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001048)
【Rintaro】I get it... I get it... I expected it would turn out like this...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001058)
【Rintaro】I'm already tired... I want to rest forever... So, that's enough...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001068)
【Rintaro】Haha, ha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001082)
【Mayuri】Okarin!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C2)
Suddenly my cheek is struck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D2)
A hot numbness spreads.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E2)
【Rintaro】What... are...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F2)
This is the first time Mayuri has doen such a thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001102)
I was so shocked, I came to my senses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001128)
【Mayuri】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001138)
Tears stream out of the eyes Mayuri is peeking at me with.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001148)
Her small body gently embraces mine, drenched in Kurisu's blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001158)
【Mayuri】Okarin... isn't the type to give up halfway...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001172)
【Mayuri】Mayushii knows. You never, ever give up until the very end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001330)
【Mayuri】Do you remember? Every day, in front of Granny's grave, when Mayushii would mutter "Save me" in her heart--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001340)
【Mayuri】Okarin would also come every day to meet Mayushii...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001350)
【Mayuri】Even on rainy days or snowy days, you would never fail to come beside Mayushii, and keep calling out Mayushii's name...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001360)
【Mayuri】You know, it's because Okarin was always there for Mayushii... that I was finally able to say farewell to Granny.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145A)
【Mayuri】So? That's why, Okarin, Mayushii doesn't quite understand, but you mustn't give up...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146A)
【Mayuri】I want you... to cheer up...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147A)
Mayuri's gentle warmth embraces me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000148A)
But no matter how much she clings to me, strength still doesn't return to my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000149A)
【Rintaro】But... I killed her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001650)
The person most important to me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001660)
The person who asked me to save her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001670)
【Rintaro】I... killed her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001756)
【Mayuri】Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001766)
The knife I stabbed into Kurisu's chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001776)
That cruel sensation still lingers in my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001786)
I look over Mayuri's shoulder, at my own hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001824)
A hand stained blood red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001834)
A hand wet with Kurisu's blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001844)
My fingertips shake, and do not stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F6)
My flowing tears blur that redness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001906)
My heart seems like it will burst from despair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001916)
Feelings of guilt crush my chest deep within.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001926)
If Suzuha hadn't taken the knife away, I might have slit my own throat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001936)
This reality is too harsh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001946)
But this is retribution for obtaining and using a godlike ability to control the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195E)
It was wrong to use a <DICT>cheat code</DICT>, an ability unavailable to normal people-- a godlike ability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196E)
Kurisu can't be saved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197E)
That's been proven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198E)
At the very least, I can't do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199E)
No matter how much Mayuri encourages me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AE)
【Rintaro】It's useless...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C8)
【Suzuha】It's not useless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D8)
Right after Suzuha murmurs this in a voice full of conviction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0A)
A familiar mail tone melody goes off close by.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B1A)
Mayuri takes out from her pocket my cell phone that she's been looking after.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B34)
【Mayuri】Okarin, a mail...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B44)
Mayuri gently puts the phone in my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B54)
I didn't have any energy to look at the mail, but for some reason, Suzuha urges me to look at it with a gesture.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BCA)
I reluctantly open up the mail arrival screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C94)
What's this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA4)
Watch TV...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB4)
Nothing else is written.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC4)
I've never seen the sender's address.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD4)
A prank? Spam mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE4)
Bewildered and not knowing who sent it, I casually look at the send time--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF4)
I gasp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D04)
The send time:

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE6)
Eh? No way, then this is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF6)
I didn't think something was wrong or that it was a misrepresentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E06)
Because I already know this phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E16)
【Rintaro】A D-mail...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E26)
I unintentionally look up at Suzuha's face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E76)
Suzuha notices and peeks at my cell phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E90)
【Suzuha】Just like I heard...! It really reached...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA0)
Seeing her open her eyes in surprise, it seemed like she didn't know the details.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB0)
Suzuha leapt from 2036. There's about an 11 year difference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC0)
Meaning this D-mail is unrelated to Suzuha?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EDA)
【Mayuri】What does it mean by watch TV-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF4)
【Suzuha】It says to watch it, doesn't it? It's trying to tell us something!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F04)
【Itaru】Heey, I bought the stuff!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F14)
Right on time, Daru came back, carrying a convience store bag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F30)
My phone has 1 SEG capabilities. We can watch TV with that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F46)
When we get a signal, what's shown is some foreign airport. Parked there is a jumbo jet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F56)
On closer inspection, the plane's tail is burnt black.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F66)
The subtitle says Fire Accident on Russian Airplane.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F76)
【Reporter】A fire broke out mid flight on Russian Airline flight 801 from Narita to Moscow, Russian authorities have announced.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F86)
【Reporter】Russian Airline flight 801 departed Narita Airport at 11:05 Japan time, but just before arriving at Moscow, a fire broke out in the cargo hold.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F96)
【Reporter】The flight made an emergency landing in Domodedovo International Airport, and the passengers were evacuated. There were no casualties.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA6)
【Reporter】On Russian Airline flight 801, where the incident occured, was a Japanese scientist who had declared emigration to Russia--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB6)
The screen changed, and the camera cut to what appears to be inside the airport lobby.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC6)
There I see a familiar face, and stop breathing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002026)
【Rintaro】Doctor... Nakabachi...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002036)
【Reporter】--Doctor Nakabachi, otherwise known as Makise Shouichi, earlier made these comments to the press.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002046)
Emigration to Russia?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002056)
Nakabachi is emigrating to Russia...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002066)
I don't think I've ever really heard the word emigration in Japan in this day and age.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002076)
I mean, you can just go to Russia any time you want without bothering with that mess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002086)
Still unable to stand from the shock of killing Kurisu, I merely gaze at the TV as if watching a dream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002096)
【Nakabachi】I'm truly delighted to have been able to safely emigrate here to wonderful Russia. I deeply thank the Russian government for accepting me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A6)
"--how was it inside the plane during the accident?" the subtitles read, in vertical writing on the right side of the screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B6)
【Nakabachi】Inside the plane, it smelled like something was burning, but I was completely calm. Some passengers were panicking, but I stayed quiet throughout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C6)
Nakabachi responds with a face full of confidence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D6)
He seems like a completely different man from the one who lost his temper against Kurisu on that day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E6)
【Nakabachi】Send my compliments to the pilot for his safe landing. He is a hero, who saved not only me, but the historic thesis written by me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F6)
The subtitles change to "--Is that thesis related to your current emigration?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002106)
Nakabachi makes an overemphasized nod.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002116)
【Nakabachi】Indeed. If I were to lose this thesis, it would delay humanity's scientific growth by a hundred years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002126)
【Nakabachi】It's such a serious thesis that it will decide the fate of humanity's future! This is it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002136)
"--What's the thesis' contents?" read the subtitles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002146)
【Nakabachi】The thesis concerns humanity's first realization of time travel, understand!? I, Doctor Nakabachi, am the first in the entire world to have successfully developed it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002156)
Nakabachi's tone gradually heats up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002166)
He starts talking directly to the camera.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002176)
Moreover, instead of talking about the airplane accident, he's just promoting his research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002186)
And then what he shows to the camera, is that envelope--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002196)
The document Kurisu put together about time travel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A6)
【Nakabachi】Packed in here are the dreams of humanity! I plan to announce it to the scientific society. Then, all of humanity will be in fear, and praise my name!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B6)
I wasn't worthy to criticize Nakabachi, who had abandoned Kurisu's stabbed body, and escaped with that envelope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021C6)
But at the same time, I recall from the back of my ears, the words Kurisu had said that enraged Nakabachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022A6)
【Kurisu】You're stealing... my thesis? That was the last thing I thought you'd do--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F0)
Even though he was accused as so, Nakabachi was now claiming his deceased daughter's thesis as his own.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002300)
Dead men tell no tales, is it...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002310)
I grind my teeth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002320)
【Nakabachi】I originally planned to put this envelope in my checked suitcase. But if I had, the thesis would have burned in the cargo hold, and that would be the end of humanity's dreams.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002330)
【Nakabachi】However! As if God had declared "Let Doctor Nakabachi's greatness be known the world over", fate played a fortunate prank on me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002340)
Nakabachi aproaches the camera more and more, presenting the palm of his hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002350)
【Nakabachi】The work of God is this! Because this was inside the envelope, it set off the checked baggage metal detector.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002360)
【Nakabachi】I had to take the envelope out of the suitcase and bring it on board!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002370)
【Nakabachi】Not too long ago, I called the pilot a hero, but the true hero who protected the dreams of humanity is this small figurine!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002380)
What was placed on his hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002390)
Was round lump of metal with a black luster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023A0)
Its size was no more than five centimeters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B0)
【Mayuri】Ah-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C0)
Beside me, Mayuri points at the LCD.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D0)
What was projected on the screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E0)
What Nakabachi was holding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F0)
If you take a good look at it, it wasn't a mere lump of metal--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243C)
【Mayuri】It's that 'Metal Upa' I lost back then! Look, look, see? It has Mayushii's signature-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244C)
Upa is the mascot character of the card game RaiNet Access Battlers popular not just in Japan, but among children worldwide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000245C)
There's a "Upa" cushion placed in our lab. That was something Mayuri received from a regular customer at "MayQueen+Nyan⑯".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000246C)
All over Akihabara, you can see them in capsule toys and on cell phone straps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000247C)
But among all of them, the Metal Upa is the most rare.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000248C)
What Nakabachi was presenting to the camera on screen was that very same Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000249C)
And on the butt of that "Metal Upa" written with cute characters in gaudy red magic marker was--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024AC)
Mayushii's!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024BC)
【Itaru】Geh, seriously!? Why does Nakabachi have that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024CC)
【Mayuri】I dropped it in the assembly hall during his presentation-. I searched for it, but gave up when I couldn't find it... So this old man had it-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024DC)
【Mayuri】I can't go all the way to Russia to get it back-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024EC)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002580)
Dumbfounded, I shut the screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002590)
I'm getting goosebumps for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025A0)
My body is shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025B0)
I notice the cause of the goosebumps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C0)
【Rintaro】The Butterfly Effect...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000260C)
In Akihabara, Tokyo, in the assembly hall at the presentation we went to three weeks ago...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000261C)
That piddly little character strap Mayuri lost ended up deciding the fate of the Nakabachi Thesis that caused World War III.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000262C)
In the end, it was that Metal Upa that protected the Nakabachi Thesis from the fire.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000264C)
And consequently, the world ends up wrapped in World War III...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E0)
【Rintaro】Suzuha, did you... know this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026FA)
【Suzuha】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000270A)
Suzuha answers me with an apologetic look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000271A)
【Rintaro】That last D-mail from 2025... who sent it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000272A)
What it meant by Watch TV was clear from the news regarding Doctor Nakabachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000273A)
【Suzuha】Sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274A)
Suzuha apologizes with a meek face.

What does she mean, sorry?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000276A)
What is she sorry for?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002784)
【Suzuha】Sorry for not clearly explaining things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002794)
【Suzuha】But you know, Uncle Okarin told me that no matter what, we had to fail once at saving Makise Kurisu's life.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027A4)
What the hell...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027B4)
【Rintaro】I've... been tricked...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027C4)
【Suzuha】It's not like I meant to trick you. Apparently, it was necessary for the plan. That's what I was told.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027D4)
Told... by whom?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027EE)
【Suzuha】I'm sorry for giving you such a painful memory, Uncle Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027FE)
【Rintaro】I don't understand. Explain...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002818)
【Suzuha】No need.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002828)
Suzuha points to the phone I'm clutching.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002838)
【Suzuha】Listen and you'll understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002848)
【Rintaro】Listen? ...to what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002858)
【Suzuha】It should "already" be in that phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002868)
【Suzuha】A message from 2025 Uncle Okarin himself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002878)
【Rintaro】...eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002888)
【Suzuha】A movie mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FE)
【Suzuha】Your phone received it, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290E)
【Rintaro】Ah...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291E)
I certainly did receive it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292E)
When was that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000293E)
July 28. That day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000294E)
Right after I first met Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000295E)
Right when I tried calling Mayuri, I received a mysterious movie mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000296E)
The sender was an address I've never seen before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000297E)
Is she talking about that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000298E)
【Rintaro】But there was nothing in it. All there was was noise...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A8)
【Suzuha】If you try now--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B8)
Suzuhas lips twist into a grin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C8)
【Suzuha】If you try now, after "failing once at saving Makise Kurisu's life"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D8)
【Suzuha】You should be able to see it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E8)
...are you're kidding me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F8)
Is that even possible?
