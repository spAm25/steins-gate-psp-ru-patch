#WRITE(PTR, $00000A12)
Squatting against the chain fence on the rooftop, I close my eyes shut.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB0)
The actions I took that day. The actions Mayuri took. The subject of my conversation with Kurisu. The subject of Nakabachi's interview.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B98)
I try remembering each one as clearly as I can, pulling my memories outside of my head and sorting them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C80)
And then I try to simulate what actions I should take.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D02)
【Mayuri】Okariin! I got the stuff-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D22)
I open my eyes upon hearing Mayuri's voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D32)
【Rintaro】...Alright.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E56)
I take a deep breath and stand up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E66)
I had Mayuri fetch some things since she's faster on her feet than both Daru and I.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E76)
Mayuri's breathing normally even though she went all the way to the lab and back in this heat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4A)
She rushes up to me with a triumphant smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5A)
Almost like a playful puppy shaking its tail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F74)
【Mayuri】Here. Is this okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F84)
In her hand is a plastic stick about 30cm long.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F94)
I take it and nod, satisfied.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA4)
【Rintaro】Good work, Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBE)
【Mayuri】Ehhehe-. Mayushii's happy to be useful for Okarin♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD8)
【Mayuri】Ah, and while we're at it, take this too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE8)
What she presents to me while saying such, is a banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF8)
Looks like she's telling me to eat before I go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001040)
【Suzuha】What's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
【Mayuri】It's a banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106A)
【Suzuha】No, I mean that stick thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107A)
【Rintaro】This isn't a stick, but a sword.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000116C)
【Rintaro】An invention from our lab, Future Gadget No.6: Cyalume Saber
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001186)
【Suzuha】Cyalume Saber?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CE)
【Itaru】A red glow stick. They're essential for idol or voice actress concerts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DE)
【Rintaro】But it's not just a glow stick. It's saber shaped, just like its name implies, so you can reenact Spark Wars.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F8)
【Suzuha】Waah, cool
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001208)
【Rintaro】Furthermore, it can also create fake blood. If you detach the cap at the tip, thick blood starts flowing out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001222)
【Suzuha】I, I just don't understand what you were trying to accomplish at all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123C)
【Itaru】You can make more realistic sword fights.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000124C)
【Rintaro】Meaning that everything was inevitable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001266)
【Suzuha】I get what you're going to do. You're going to use that fake blood as a stand in for Makise Kurisu's blood, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001276)
【Rintaro】Indeed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001286)
Entranced by my own genius, I stuff my cheeks with banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001296)
I am a pure mad scientist after all, fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001364)
I put the Cyalume Saber in my pocket. Since it's about 30cm long, it sticks out a little, but I don't mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001374)
I also put the stun gun Daru just bought into my pocket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001384)
With this, all preparations are complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001394)
I give Suzuha a glance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013DC)
【Suzuha】...Uncle Okarin. Let's leap to that day once more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EC)
【Suzuha】To July 28.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FC)
【Suzuha】There's only enough fuel left in the time machine for one more round trip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140C)
【Suzuha】Meaning this is our last chance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001426)
【Suzuha】...shall we go?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001436)
【Rintaro】Leave it to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001446)
【Rintaro】I will change the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014CC)
I get on board the time machine again with Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014DC)
By the way, about what will happen if I meet the "me" that already returned once-- in other words, the me that stabbed Kurisu to death, I already asked Suzuha beforehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EC)
The conclusion is that we won't meet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014FC)
The world line where I already killed Kurisu is minutely different from where we're time traveling to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150C)
Meaning time travel slightly changes the world line divergence ratio.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151C)
Though of course, that value is still within the error range of the attractor field, so it can't make any concrete changes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152C)
But it's not like a parallel world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153C)
In the end, attractor field convergence causes it to become the same world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000154C)
Deceiving the world and the first me by time traveling isn't meaningless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000155C)
【Mayuri】Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156C)
Mayuri bends herself towards the hatch, and gently strokes my cheek.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000157C)
【Mayuri】Come back, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158C)
【Rintaro】Of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159C)
Returning a smile, I thrust my thumb upwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
Daru and Mayuri see me off with words of encouragement as I close the hatch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
Suzuha had already started to operate the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E4)
【Suzuha】The fate of the future also hangs on this mission.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F4)
Suzuha speaks while operating the buttons.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001604)
【Suzuha】We're counting on you, Uncle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001614)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001680)
Without answering, I silently close my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001690)
Strangely, my heart is very calm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A0)
No haste, nor tension.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B0)
None of the anxiety from the first leap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C0)
How many times have I failed till now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D0)
Feeding my ego, I've sacrificed many memories, and hurt many people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E0)
Though I did undo each of those failures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F0)
They are firmly engraved into my memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A8)
【Rintaro2】You mustn't deny those mere three weeks you experienced "drifting through world lines".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B8)
【Rintaro2】You musn't "undo" them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E2)
Everything has a meaning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F2)
Not a single thing was meaningless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001902)
I'm no longer afraid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001912)
I can't be afraid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001922)
To repay all of those memories I sacrificed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001932)
I'm self-confident to be standing here at this moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001942)
I will surely reach my goal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001952)
The unknown world line, the Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001962)
The future is unknown. But that's how it should be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001972)
So there's no point in thinking about the future now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001982)
There's no point in wavering either. There's just one thing I should focus on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001992)
--Saving Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B8C)
The sensation of my back being pulled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9C)
Rainbow sparkles start drifting around my field of vision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAC)
Let's begin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBC)
This is the final crusade.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000204C)
I exit the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000205C)
An empty, dreary rooftop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000206C)
A little bit away I can see the top of the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000207C)
This is the third time I've been here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000208C)
Just once more, I simulate in my head what I should do now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000209C)
Though my time restriction is fairly strict, I have no choice but to do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020AC)
No, it's been decided I have to do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020BC)
That's what I tell myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002132)
After waiting for Suzuha to break the lock, I rush inside like last time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B4)
Once again, I barely miss the first me, and stop at the 7th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C4)
Last time I went all the way down to the fourth floor, but this time I didn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D4)
I set my attention to the capsule toy area near the landing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E4)
There is the first thing I should do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002330)
RaiNet Kakeru 3D Character Doll Series
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002340)
This is it. In this capsule toy machine, I managed to get the super rare Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002350)
Without hesitating, I insert the 100 yen coin I prepared before hand, and forcefully turn the lever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C6)
A capsule falls out of door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D6)
Right as I pick it up--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E6)
【Mayuri】Wah-. It's "RaiNet"-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002406)
I hide my face in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002416)
Mayuri's voice is getting closer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002426)
Gah, she's already coming?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002436)
I hurriedly leave that place without making eye contact with Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002446)
Luckily, Mayuri was so entranced by the capsule toy machines that she didn't notice I was Okabe Rintaro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002564)
Going down to the fourth floor, I check the contents of the capsule.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025B0)
Inside was the Metal Upa. The super rare, metallic Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C0)
I forcibly changed the sequence of prizes the capsule toy machine gave out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D0)
Which means that what "the first me" gets is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E0)
The answer is obvious. I turn my head back to confirm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002686)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002696)
Kurisu was standing right behind me, just about to call out to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A6)
She cowers in surprise when I suddenly turn around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C0)
【Kurisu】H, hey, weren't you just on the roofto--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D0)
【Rintaro】I'm going to--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026EA)
【Kurisu】Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026FA)
【Rintaro】...I'm going to save you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000270A)
Leave everything to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000271A)
【Kurisu】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000272A)
I say no more. Because if I tell her everything here, Kurisu will no longer have a reason to talk to the first me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000273A)
On the other hand, I need to leave the truth of trying to tell her something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274A)
If I don't, then after this, Kurisu won't have a reason to take out the me who picks a fight with Doctor Nakabachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000275A)
I tap Kurisu's shoulders, and once again run up the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002774)
【Kurisu】Ah, wait--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291A)
I run up to the sixth floor, and peek at how things are going on the seventh floor from underneath the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029FA)
When I look at the capsule toy machine again, instead of Mayuri, the first me is there, just now turning the lever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A68)
【Mayuri】Ah, it's a "Upa".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A78)
【Rintaro】Is it rare?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A88)
【Mayuri】It's not rare, but isn't it just so cute-? Mayushii loves "Upa".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B26)
I grin at my little secret.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B36)
I changed the order after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B46)
Meaning what Mayuri is signing now is just a Upa, not a Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B56)
And that means--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BBA)
【Chairman】--Will the audience for today's presentation, Doctor Nakabachi's Time Machine Invention Commemoration, please gather at the assembly hall. Thank you very much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C58)
The voice from the eighth floor mic announces the beginning of the presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C68)
The first me goes up to the eighth floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C78)
But without moving from that spot, Mayuri takes out a pen and starts signing the Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C88)
Just as planned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D26)
When Doctor Nakabachi emigrated to Russia on August 21, he had the Metal Upa that Mayuri had signed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D36)
If we exchange that metal for plastic, then it should get affected by the fire accident on Nakabachi's plane.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D46)
But the one question that remains is how exactly Mayuri's Upa got into the hands of Doctor Nakabachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F1A)
I keep peeking at Mayuri, who nods with satisfaction after she finishes her signature, and jogs after the "first me".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F2A)
She puts "Upa" into her coat pocket--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F3A)
Or at least she tries, but it doesn't go in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F4A)
It falls down and rolls away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F5A)
Mayuri runs up the stairs without even noticing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6A)
Upa fell all the way to the landing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F7A)
Did Nakabachi pick that up?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F8A)
But Nakabachi is now upstairs in the middle of his lecture. He doesn't have an opportunity to pick it up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003144)
And then, Kurisu comes up from downstairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003154)
I hurry up and hide myself on the other side of the seventh floor landing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003164)
I was saved by the staircase's special shape. If it were shaped normally, I wouldn't have had an escape route.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032DC)
Kurisu goes up to the seventh floor without noticing me, notices the fallen Upa, and picks it up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032EC)
I see... So Kurisu picked up the Upa from there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032FC)
The Butterfly Effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000330C)
This casual event has a huge effect on the Russian passenger plane fire three weeks from now, and then even causes World War III.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003410)
Kurisu picks up Upa and worriedly looks around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003420)
Perhaps she's searching for the owner, but of course, Kurisu doesn't know who Mayuri is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003430)
At this point in time, those two aren't even acquaintances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003568)
In the end, Kurisu puts Upa into the envelope she's carrying, and goes up to the eighth floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003578)
Confirming everything so far, I head towards the passage on the eighth floor.
