#WRITE(PTR, $00000482)
About 22 hours after I proposed my godlike alternative plan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D6)
【Luka】H-hello....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E6)
Luka shyly visits the lab the same way he did yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004F6)
When our eyes meet, he gives me a bashful smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000510)
【Luka】Mother had a pager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000064C)
【Mayuri】Wah-. That's great-, Luka-kun-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065C)
【Kurisu】Now we can move along.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066C)
【Itaru】Luka-shi's girl version... will definitely be moe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067C)
Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru are already on standby.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000722)
Sending a D-mail to a pager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000732)
Yesterday, we argued whether or not that's possible, and eventually settled that it'll probably be okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000742)
We're still just sending data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000752)
The rest depends on the pager radio wave stations 18 years ago, but it should be fine as long as our data gets through safely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000762)
We already googled how to send data to a pager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000772)
Using a contemporary pager, you would first enter the other person's pager number, then, if in the Kanto region, enter *2*2.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000782)
And then after that, you would enter in numbers which would be displayed on the other person's tiny LCD. It seems like that's how it works.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000792)
Pagers in 1992 could still only send numbers. And since number display functions were also not yet implemented, the other person would be unable to see your number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A2)
A few years after that, pagers started to implement katakana and then kanji displays, making them not too dissimilar to current cellphone mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B2)
Therefore, the D-mail Lukako's about to send-- it's technically not a mail, though-- has to be sent in numerical form.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C2)
Of course, I have a conversion table for that at hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D2)
You can even find information from 18 years ago if you just google it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E2)
I was quite irritated that information on pagers was fairly scarce, but that's my little secret.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093C)
【Kurisu】Urushibara-san, you yourself need to think about what text to send to your mother in the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E8)
【Luka】Eh...? I do...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8C)
【Rintaro】If you want to grant your own wish, then you should clear your own path to it. We are merely your outriders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B30)
【Luka】Understood...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD4)
We explain to Lukako the function of the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C78)
The numbers we're sending are half-width, so we can send 36 of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
The pager's number → letter conversion uses two numbers to correspond to one hiragana character.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC0)
Furthermore, since you first need to input *2*2, that means you can only send 16 hiragana characters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E64)
Lukako understands everything and takes out a notebook, writing drafts of the pager message.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
I showed Lukako the site I found.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
CONCERNING PAGER NUMBER AND LETTER CONVERSION is sloppily written across the browser in Gothic typeface.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
【Luka】Umm....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F4)
Pager typing is commonly known as two touch typing or pager input.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001198)
Cellphone operation differs somewhat, where you choose the consonant and then input the vowel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123C)
The consonants are A Ka Sa Ta Na Ha Ma Ya Ra Wa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E0)
The vowels are a, i, u, e, o.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001384)
Basically, to input Ke,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001428)
You'd press 2 to input the consonant Ka,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014CC)
Next, you'd press 4 for the vowel e.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001620)
【Itaru】This is pretty annoying. I think if you typed "831831831"... then that would be okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C4)
【Mayuri】Why 831-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
【Itaru】831 for "Ya Sa I", durr. VEGGIES VEGGIES VEGGIES-- we just have to drill this into Luka-shi's mother's brain
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001816)
【Rintaro】She'd just end up treating that message like a prank.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BA)
【Mayuri】Then, then, how about "29292929"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195E)
【Rintaro】I'll hear you out, but what does that mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A02)
【Mayuri】MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA6)
【Rintaro】Why do you want her to like meat!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B4A)
【Mayuri】That's not it-. If you keep repeating "MEAT Meeaaat-" then instead, I think she'd start to hate meat and want to eat vegetables, don't you think-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BFC)
【Itaru】Yeah...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C16)
 no.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB8)
Lukako completes his composition while we speak our nonsense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD0)
【Luka】How about something like this...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DEA)
【Luka】"MOM EAT VEGGIES OKAY"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E32)
【Itaru】Isn't that a little too direct?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E42)
【Rintaro】Isn't that first "MOM" unnecessary? It'll just leave more room for doubt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E5C)
【Luka】Then... "EAT VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A HEALTHY GIRL"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E76)
【Kurisu】That's too much of a stretch... And it's over the character limit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E90)
【Luka】"EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID..."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EAA)
【Itaru】Wait a sec. According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for dakuten.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EBA)
【Itaru】So that sentence is four half width characters over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED4)
【Rintaro】Then a little modification. How about "EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EEE)
【Kurisu】Isn't that too informal? You're talking to Urushibara-san's mother, right? Would she understand the "VEG 4" part?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EFE)
【Rintaro】You have any bright ideas?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F1C)
Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and says no more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F2C)
Looks like it's settled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F74)
【Mayuri】Then let's hurry and type it out-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FEA)
When sending to a pager, the number encoded message is handled like a telephone number, so we enter the input into the X68000 setting screan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000209C)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>

<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020CC)
The random and lengthy string of numbers is complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DC)
【Rintaro】Alright, preparations are A-OK.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020EC)
Now we just activate the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and have Lukako call.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020FC)
The timer is set to "154152#". With this, it'll reach around January 1, 1993. Measurement error is around 1~3 days. Leap year calculation's a pain, so I ignored it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002144)
【Luka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002154)
Lukako's slender finger starts to tremble on top of the enter button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002164)
【Rintaro】Ready? It's starting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002174)
We're entering the time frame for the Microwave Ophone (Temp) to start the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000219E)
After Lukako looks at me once with a teary face, he faintly nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E8)
The discharge phenomenon soon occurs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002402)
Lukako flinches and takes a step back, but soon stiffens his expression as he pushes the enter button--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000249E)
WD04.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000285C)
I feel vertigo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000286C)
I soon stop standing straight and place my hand on the table to support myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000287C)
After staying still for awhile, the vertigo slowly fades.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288C)
As if on cue, color gradually restores to the monochrome world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028AC)
【Rintaro】Nn...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028BC)
Again. The demon eye, Reading Steiner activated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028CC)
Did the world change?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000296E)
I look around the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B6)
Unlike with Moeka, Lukako's here as he should be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C6)
Lukako bashfully blushes once he notices my gaze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E0)
【Luka】Um, Okabe-san, could you... please not look at me so much...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F0)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A00)
I fold my arms and tilt my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A10)
Lukako's appearance didn't change a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A84)
Mainly,%T016
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A9C)
his chest,%T016
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB4)
and his breasts,%T016
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ACC)
and his bosom.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE2)
Since he's originally a guy, it's natural that his chest is free of bulges.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AF2)
But, if he turned into a girl, then that's a different story.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B02)
That washboard isn't tiny breast level. It's anti-breast level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B26)
【Rintaro】Was it... a failure...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B36)
So the "Eat lots of vegetables to give birth to a girl" thing Kurisu talked about was nothing but fringe science.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B46)
It was a mistake to believe in such a theory as a researcher, Assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B56)
【Mayuri】What was a failure-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C94)
Everyone, including Lukako, looks at me bewildered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA4)
【Rintaro】What you say? Is every last one of you growing senile? Just now, we used the Microwave Ophone (Temp) to--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D42)
I grip my mouth as soon as I start talking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D52)
They completely forgot what we did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D62)
Hasn't that been proven by all the previous experiments?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D72)
Reading Steiner's activation means the world has changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D82)
And the only one whose memories continue before and after the change is me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D92)
Therefore, nobody here recognizes what we did just now except for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF6)
【Rintaro】Sorry. No, it's nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E26)
Afterwards, Mayuri and Lukako happily go out shopping for lunch at a neighborhood convenience store.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E36)
【Rintaro】Christina. I want to ask you something... Lukako is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EAC)
【Kurisu】What perverted act are you thinking about this time? I can't be too careful around your perv duo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EC6)
【Itaru】We're not a perv duo. We are a perverted gentleman duo!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE0)
【Kurisu】Whatever. Seriously, whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EF0)
【Rintaro】Mmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F00)
N-now I can't ask her. It's really annoying how they don't remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F10)
Just what sort of misunderstandings would asking Did Lukako turn into a woman? bring?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F20)
It's scary just imagining it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F30)
I should wait until I can meet with Lukako alone, and check then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F40)
But considering how his appearance didn't change at all, it's very likely that the sex change failed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F50)
In that case, just what did Lukako's D-mail just change?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F60)
Same thing with Moeka. The result was different from expected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F70)
This problem might be out of my control...
<FILEEND16>
