The time machine regains function thanks to Daru's skill.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
Mayuri and I help drain the on board water.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C4)
Though, it's still sticking out of Radio Kaikan's wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099A)
Daru looks over that satellite-looking machine with a satisfied look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA4)
Mayuri is merrymaking. Kurisu rushed over here after completing the Time Leap Machine, with a relieved look on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7A)
Suzuha's forcibly attaching her beloved MTB to the satellite-like body. It seems like she really likes that MTB and intends to bring it with her to 1975.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8A)
Kurisu was worried if that might cause a time paradox.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2C)
My heart's not clear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3C)
Should I let Suzuha leave like this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4C)
That way of thinking is extremely conceited.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5C)
Suzuha doesn't belong in this era in the first place, and if she gives the answer I don't especially want to stay in this era, then I won't have any reason to detain her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6C)
Suzuha finishes fastening her MTB and smiles calmly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7C)
It's not her serious smile from yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8C)
No startup test is performed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9C)
Because activating it would be too conspicuous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAC)
So we're just going to wing it. There's no need to worry since we have the Time Leap Machine for insurance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBC)
If she has any regrets--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
It would be that we couldn't find her father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D14)
【Suzuha】Everyone, thank you, really. I don't know how to thank you enough...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC0)
【Mayuri】Don't forget about us-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD0)
【Itaru】If you want to thank me, then let's make out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEA)
【Kurisu】Control yourself, pervert.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFA)
Everyone encourages Suzuha in their own way and taps her on the shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4A)
【Suzuha】Oh right. Take this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E96)
Suzuha takes out her pin badge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA6)
Her father's memento with the strange writing OSHM***A 7010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB6)
In the end, we couldn't decipher that writing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC6)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro. I'll give this to you. You can just place it somewhere in that lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED6)
【Rintaro】You...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE6)
So Suzuha has lingering attachment to this era after all...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF6)
Does she want to leave it behind?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F06)
Does she want to leave behind the proof that the girl named Amane Suzuha lived in this era?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F16)
【Itaru】About the pin badge...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
Daru timidly opens his mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA8)
【Itaru】What do you say we make duplicates for all the lab mems? As the lab mem' testiment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC2)
【Mayuri】Wah-. That might be really good-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001040)
【Kurisu】That's oddly thoughtful of you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
【Suzuha】Ahaha, somehow, if you use it like that, it kind of embarrasses me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001060)
【Itaru】Anyway, we already took a picture of it, so keep that badge, Amane-shi. It's your old man's precious memento, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107A)
【Suzuha】Yeah... I'll do that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A6)
I don't say anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B6)
I had detained Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C6)
But because of that, I couldn't save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D6)
I--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001124)
【Mayuri】Hey, he-y! Dahdahdahda-h. Mayushii's has an important announcement to make-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001134)
Mayuri raises her hand, raising her voice in even higher spirits than before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001144)
I thought she was just being overly optimistic since she doesn't know about the time machine's one way limitation, but I'm interested in that important announcement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001154)
Just what is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001164)
Don't tell me, did Mayuri find out... her fate to die in a few hours?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001174)
I quickly glance at Kurisu, but she just seems as confused as I am.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001184)
So, that important announcement...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001194)
【Mayuri】Actually, Mayushii found Suzu-san's father!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001240)
【Rintaro】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
【Suzuha】Eh!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001260)
【Itaru】Seriously!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B0)
Mayuri sticks out her chest in confidence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C0)
【Mayuri】Wanna meet him-? You wanna meet him, dontcha-? So with that said, her father's here with us today-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D0)
【Suzuha】W-where?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E0)
Everyone besides Mayuri is stupidly looking about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F0)
The dreary Radio Kaikan event space. Nobody's here besides us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001300)
Wait, is he hiding at the entrance?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131A)
【Mayuri】So now-, allow me to announce. Suzu-san's father--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132A)
【Mayuri】Drrrrrrrrrrrr
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133A)
【Itaru】Whoa, self drum roll!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001354)
【Mayuri】Tadidah! Suzu-san's father--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001364)
Ending her oral drum froll, Mayuri grins at Suzuha and--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137E)
【Mayuri】Is Daru-kun!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138E)
She points at Daru with a snap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B6)
Everybody's mouthes drop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C6)
After awkward silence comes awkward laughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140E)
【Kurisu】That logic is unacceptable as a joke. It's impossible for this pervert to get married in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001456)
【Itaru】Hey, that's kind of hurtful, you know...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001466)
【Rintaro】No, I completely agree with Christina. It's been decided that when Daru reaches age 30, he will class change into a wizard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001476)
【Itaru】Be nicer, yous guys. But it's the truth, so I can't object...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001516)
Heartbroken, Daru finally collapses on all fours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001526)
Suzuha herself gives a troubled reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A4)
【Suzuha】Hmm, my Father wasn't this fat in the first place, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BE)
【Mayuri】Geez. You're all so mean to Daru-kun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A0)
【Itaru】Uha, Mayu-shi's the only one to stand up for me. You're an angel. So will you fall in love with me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
【Mayuri】Nope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176A)
Daru, rejected with one word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177A)
【Mayuri】You know, by Mayushii's reasoning, Daru-kun abso-lutely must be Suzu-san's father-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
【Kurisu】So tell us. How can you prove it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E4)
【Mayuri】You know, I've always been thinking about the writing on the pin badge-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FE)
【Mayuri】And so, after staring at it, I noticed the 7 in the "7010" is a little bit weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180E)
【Mayuri】This isn't a 7, it's a 2. It's just missing the bottom line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185E)
【Suzuha】Eh, really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AA)
Suzuha stares at the pin badge's writing again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BA)
【Suzuha】It's so small, I can't tell...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CA)
【Mayuri】If you magnify the picture, you'll notice-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018DA)
【Kurisu】2010? As in, AD? That's this year, isn't it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018EA)
【Rintaro】Then, what do the first letters mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018FA)
OSHM***A 7010
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190A)
That's what's written on the pin badge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191A)
【Mayuri】It's simple-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192A)
【Mayuri】Okabe, Shiina, Hashida, Makise. Lastly, Amane.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193A)
【Itaru】Wait...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194A)
That was an unexpected blind spot since it was so simple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195A)
【Itaru】It's the lab mem's initials!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196A)
【Mayuri】So I was thinking about why 2010, when I remembered it's the year of the lab mems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197A)
I don't really get what the year of the lab mems is, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198A)
【Mayuri】The Future Gadget Laboratory was founded this year.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199A)
【Suzuha】So that's what it is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A24)
【Mayuri】And you know? Whenever Suzu-san would talk about the future, stories of Okarin and Chris-chan would pop out, but there wasn't a single story about Daru-kun, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A34)
【Itaru】There weren't any about Mayu-shi either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A44)
Daru's obvious question startles me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5E)
【Mayuri】That's because Mayushii's a lab mem, but she didn't make a time machine, and she doesn't like fighting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A6E)
...That's not it. The reason there aren't any stories of Mayuri is because she dies in a few hours. Knowing that fact, Kurisu and I, as well as Suzuha, say nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7E)
【Mayuri】But you know, Daru-kun is a supah hakah, and Okarin's right hand man, and together they made Microwave Ophone-chan, so I thought it was strange he never came up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACE)
【Kurisu】His name never came up, meaning he falsified his name, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE8)
【Mayuri】The people who founded Suzu-san's Resistance included Okarin and Mr. Barrel Titor, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B02)
【Mayuri】And he was someone in Akiba in 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
【Mayuri】And he independently studied time machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B22)
【Mayuri】And Okabe's "Reading Spaghetti"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B32)
【Rintaro】"Reading Steiner".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B42)
【Mayuri】And he knows about that thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B5C)
【Mayuri】So, doesn't that fit Daru-kun perfectly?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6C)
【Kurisu】Certainly
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B86)
【Mayuri】Also, do you remember about the day Suzu-san tried to meet her father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
【Mayuri】She thought if she went to the time machine offline meet, she could meet her him, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
We understood that since we tailed her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
【Mayuri】By the way, Daru-kun tried to go there too, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C06)
【Itaru】That was a seriously important offline meet for Japanese SF history... Well, it was lucky that we also got to tail Amane-shi though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C22)
I don't remember that time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C32)
Because the world line changed via D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C42)
This is the curse of "Reading Steiner" so to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C52)
My memories before the change continue afterwards, so conversely, I have no memories of past events after the world line changes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF6)
【Suzuha】I heard about that offline meet from Father. I only faintly remember it from childhood, but anyway, I thought I could meet him if I went there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D06)
【Itaru】So, since we met at that meet, does that settle it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D20)
【Suzuha】Hmmm, I wonder. At that point, maybe I couldn't recognize Hashida Itaru as Father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D30)
But that increases the circumstantial evidence that Daru is her father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4A)
【Mayuri】Also, the time machine's name. She said it was something like FG204 Something Something, umm, what was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D64)
【Suzuha】FG204 2nd EDITION ver. 2.31
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D74)
【Rintaro】Ugh, th-that naming sense, it's Daru's no doubt!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D8E)
【Mayuri】And I think that FG definitely stands for Future Gadget-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9E)
So in other words, this time machine, is Future Gadget No. 204...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DAE)
【Mayuri】Lastly, the name. I think Mr. Barrel Titor can be nobody else but Daru-kun-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DFE)
【Kurisu】That reminds me, last night, Mayuri asked me "What's barrel in Japanese?".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E46)
【Mayuri】Barrel means "taru" doesn't it? Chris-chan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E56)
Kurisu nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E66)
【Rintaro】...taru... Daru!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB6)
【Suzuha】A-a pun!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED0)
【Mayuri】So, so, Suzu-san. Say "Hashida Itaru" ten times fast-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE0)
【Suzuha】Wh-why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF0)
【Mayuri】You'll know if you say it-. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F0A)
【Suzuha】HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F24)
【Mayuri】Just now, didn't you hear "Ditor"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F74)
【Kurisu】I did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F84)
【Mayuri】Hashidaitaru. Hashi-daita-ru. Hashi-Ditor-ru. Hashi-Titor-ru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FDA)
【Itaru】Really...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FF4)
【Mayuri】Yeah, really♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002004)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002020)
I-I can't believe it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002030)
With all this circumstantial evidence, I really can't just deny it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002040)
Everyone's jaw drops for a different reason this time, comparing Daru and Suzuha's looks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B6)
【Mayuri】I think they really look like father and daughter-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020CE)
【Kurisu】That might be the <DICT>Placebo Effect</DICT>. When you mention it, they do kinda look alike.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DE)
【Rintaro】Quite the achievement. Great Detective Shiina Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F8)
【Mayuri】Eh? Detective? Ehhehe-, that's the first time anyone's said that-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002108)
This girl seems like she's airheaded, but maybe she's unexpectedly perceptive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002186)
【Itaru】Ah, augh... D-daughter...? Amane-shi is my daughter...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002196)
Daru squints his eyes and points at Suzuha while flapping his lips like a goldfish out of the tank.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021BC)
【Suzuha】...Father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021CC)
【Itaru】A, aa, at times like these, call me "Papa".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
【Kurisu】At times like these, stop being a perv...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021EC)
【Suzuha】Father...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002244)
Suzuha tries to hold back her tears, but couldn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
The tears fell from her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000226E)
【Itaru】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000227E)
Daru also looks at that crying face and becomes seriously quiet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000228E)
【Suzuha】I came... So I could meet you, Father... I came riding on the time machine you made...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000229E)
【Itaru】...yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022AE)
【Suzuha】I'll be sure to accomplish what you tried to do, father...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022BE)
【Itaru】...yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022CE)
【Suzuha】So I want you to watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E8)
【Itaru】I'll watch. I absolutely will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F8)
Suzuha walks up to Daru and quietly hugs him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002308)
Daru awkwardly, but firmly, catches her in his arms.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002318)
A strange father and daughter reunion, across time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002328)
I thought it was good, from the bottom of my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234A)
【Itaru】B-by the way, was your mother cute? If she's short with a loli face but huge boobs, then <DICT>que bom</DICT>--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002364)
【Suzuha】Ahaha. That's a secret.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B4)
Suzuha separates from Daru and smiles again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C4)
【Suzuha】Well then. With this, all my regrets for this world line are completely cut away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023DE)
【Suzuha】...I should get going.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023EE)
【Rintaro】Wh-wait...! You're going already? Don't you have a lot to talk to your father about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023FE)
--What the hell am I doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000240E)
I silently click my tongue at myself while detaining Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000241E)
Even if I detain her here, Suzuha won't stay, will she?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242E)
It'll be troublesome if she does, since Mayuri's life depends on her leaving.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243E)
So why am I trying to detain Suzuha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244E)
【Suzuha】I'm okay. I'll be sure to get an IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002468)
While saying that, she shows us a dignified face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002478)
【Suzuha】Changing the future is up to you guys. I'll be sure to deliver the package here to Akihabara. Then I'll leave the rest to you all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002488)
【Suzuha】...Please. I want to change the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002498)
...Nobody answers that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A8)
Nobody says anything, or even nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B8)
But Suzuha definitely got the message.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C8)
Everything Suzuha entrusted to us. Her will. Her mission. As if swearing to protect them to the end, we tighten our expressions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D8)
The future Suzuha warned us of.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E8)
That isn't the future we wish for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F8)
That's probably the very reason Daru and I form the Resistance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002508)
That's why this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002518)
So Mayuri won't die. So Kurisu won't be used by SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002528)
So Daru can be with Suzuha as a normal father, we must change the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002542)
【Suzuha】Well then, let's meet in 35 years. Ah, for you guys, maybe a few hours, huh. Ahaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002552)
【Suzuha】Ah, oh yeah. When the time machine jumps through time, it lets off terrific ultraviolet rays, so you better not look directly at it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000256E)
With that final warning, Suzuha boards the time machine, quickly closing the hatch after waving her hand. Her figure disappears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257E)
The machine soon activates.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258E)
The revolving lights attached underneath the fuselage light up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002602)
A shrill alarm starts ringing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002612)
Nothing comes out except sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002622)
It's quieter than you'd think.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002632)
The people walking underneath the building start cheering and screaming at the abnormality of the satellite. Everyone looks up and points.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D4)
I notice I got a mail from Suzuha and hurriedly open my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002838)
That "goodbye"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002848)
The same single word parting message as before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002858)
Yet that word holds a completely different meaning than the one before. Almost like it's a different word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002918)
Right after that, the air surrounding the time machine seems to mush and warp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002928)
A cocoon of light appears, enveloping the fuselage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002938)
I squint my eyes at the brilliance--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002948)
【Rintaro】Suzuha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002958)
We can no longer meet her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002968)
No, maybe we can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002978)
We're no doubt going to meet each other again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002988)
But between us is an immense wall of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002998)
No matter how much we pray.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A8)
No matter how much we wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B8)
No matter how much we shout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C8)
When we meet again, she won't be the girl I knew.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D8)
Unexpectedly, Daru takes one step into the light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E8)
【Itaru】...Su, Susu, Suzuha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F8)
【Itaru】Be sure to meet us again!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A08)
【Itaru】I'll do my best until then! I, I hate my meager vocabulary for not knowing any other way to say it, though!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A18)
【Itaru】Anyway, I'll do my best... So Suzuha, do your best too!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A28)
Those words probably won't reach her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A38)
Within that brightness, all I can do is block the light with my hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A48)
While shining particles fall, the cocoon slowly, slowly comes undone--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B6E)
And then before I notice it, the fuselage as large as a dump truck disappears without a trace, leaving just a hole in Radio Kaikan's wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B7E)
Peeking through it, I can see Akihabara Station below.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B8E)
I can smell ozone due to the discharge of static electricity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B9E)
The atmosphere undulates in waves as if increasing in density.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BAE)
For a short while, we silently stand in the summer breeze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BBE)
As if the wind were fate itself.
