Kurisu's eating cup noodles with a fork.

【Mayuri】Sorry, Okarin. Just now, Mayushii tried to warm up some karaage.

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A4)
【Mayuri】And out of habit, I put it through reverse rotation, and then it discharged-

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B4)
【Rintaro】...I-I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CE)
【Kurisu】You should've gotten mail. Did you look at it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DE)
She says it so nonchalantly, but there's no way I could've looked at it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EE)
My phone's hooked up to the Microwave Ophone (Temp)!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FE)
Man, she's such a sarcastic woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046A)
I grind my teeth and disconnect my phone from the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005CA)
One more please?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000618)
【Rintaro】Don't screw around! Mister Braun blames me, you know!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000632)
【Kurisu】But I even advised you five days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000642)
The timestamp certainly was five days ago, but...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F8)
【Itaru】Was Manager mad?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000079C)
【Rintaro】Yeah... I felt waves of murderous intent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000840)
Daru turns pale, but the two girls don't seem to care.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E4)
Those two know not the wrath of Manager. How innocent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000988)
【Rintaro】Anyway, today, all further experiments are canceled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A36)
【Kurisu】Well, we did get sufficient experimental data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADA)
Then Kurisu yawns, hiding her mouth with her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7E)
【Kurisu】I'm dead tired, and my hair's dried out. I want to take a shower and go to sleep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C76)
I sigh and take a boxed lunch out of the convenience store bag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1A)
It got cold, so I toss it into the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and set the timer normally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCA)
【Mayuri】If you want a shower, there's one here-. It doesn't have a bathtub, so I guess I should call it a shower room? Okarin always uses it, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E6E)
【Kurisu】Seems kinda filthy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9A)
【Rintaro】I won't lie and call it clean. This entire building is in shambles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001048)
【Kurisu】In the first place, I refuse to use the same shower room as Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
【Rintaro】I know how you feel. Nobody's telling you to use it, you know. After all, since we stayed up all night, you, Daru, and I, are all pretty smelly. Heheheh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001190)
Anyway, it's the heat. And we kept the window closed the whole night. Just sitting is enough to make you sweat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001234)
【Kurisu】That's why I'm going home once I finish eating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D8)
Kurisu slurps her cup noodles indignantly. I bought them for her at her request. She was raised in America, yet she likes cup noodles. How strange.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138E)
【Rintaro】Celebrity bath time at a high class hotel, eh. I want to come along.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B0)
【Kurisu】I refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CA)
【Mayuri】Mayushii wants to come too-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
【Kurisu】Mayuri-san's welcome to come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FE)
【Mayuri】Really? Thank you-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001488)
I take my warmed convenience store boxed lunch out of the microwave, take out a fresh bottle of Dr Pepper out of the fridge, and join in on lunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D0)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, Okarin, I've been wondering, but why do you drink soda while you eat rice? Do they go well together-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E0)
【Rintaro】I don't really see a problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001528)
【Itaru】Me neither.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001570)
【Kurisu】That's true. I don't give it a second thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158A)
【Mayuri】Ehh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159A)
【Rintaro】Mayuri's the weird one. It's normal to drink carbonated drinks while eating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B4)
【Itaru】It's normal, durr.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C4)
【Kurisu】No objection.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D4)
【Mayuri】No way-. You guys are the weird ones-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EE)
Well, I'm a pure <DICT>Dr Pepperian</DICT>, Daru's loves cola like a typical %B2Spizzaota%B2E, and Kurisu lived in America, home of carbonated drinks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FE)
I admit our opinion is biased.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160E)
But that doesn't matter right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001628)
【Rintaro】Now, let's discuss Operation Urd's experimental results.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164E)
【Itaru】Operation Urd?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165E)
【Rintaro】Yesterday, because of a certain assistant, I was unable to announce the operation name. Operation Urd consists of serial D-mail--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001678)
【Kurisu】The experiments had results...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001688)
Assistant interrupts my words again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001698)
【Kurisu】At the very least, we know we can do something with D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173A)
Placing the empty noodle cup on the table, Kurisu pulls the whiteboard out of the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174A)
Then she writes some sort of list.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179E)
The three of us watch Kurisu silently write on the whiteboard while we eat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AE)
【Kurisu】And, well, it's like this. Any suggestions or objections?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BE)
Nothing especially. She's summarized the vital parts. Nobody raises their hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CE)
Mayuri's staring blankly with her mouth half open. Looks like she doesn't understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017DE)
【Rintaro】The upper limit of what can be sent in a D-mail is 36 letters in English, or 18 characters in Japanese, which is inconvenient. It's something I'd like to improve.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EE)
The dozens of experimental mails we sent were received in three parts of 12 half-width letters each. And any text after the 36th would disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FE)
【Itaru】But isn't it great we discovered we can control when it goes to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180E)
Though we can only set it in one hour increments, we can control how far back D-mails go using the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s timer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181E)
【Kurisu】There's no point to settle for just discovery. We need to find out the principle. What I've written here is nothing but verified phenomena.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182E)
【Rintaro】Investigating the principle, huh. Certainly, unless we figure that out, we can't make a true time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001900)
【Rintaro】We can only send 12x3 letters. What's the cause?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001910)
Daru and Kurisu are remain silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192A)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193A)
Suddenly, Mayuri, who had until now been staring at the ceiling in confusion, started raising her hand for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194A)
【Mayuri】You know, karaage and bananas become "gelage" and "gelbanas", but salt doesn't turn into "gelsalt", did it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001964)
【Itaru】Like I said, don't shorten it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001974)
According to what Mayuri had confirmed, the karaage that returned to the freezer had indeed become gelatinous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198E)
【Mayuri】And so, for D-mails, you can send 36 letters, but everything past that disappears, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A8)
【Mayuri】So, I think maybe you can't send big things, or a lot of things-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C2)
【Mayuri】Ah, maybe, maybe the Curb black hole--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DC)
【Kurisu】Uhh, it's Kerr black hole.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F6)
【Mayuri】The Curb black hole-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A10)
【Kurisu】Like I said, Kerr black hole.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2A)
【Mayuri】...the black hole's hole is too tight-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A44)
【Itaru】Mayu-shi... say that one more time. Starting from "hole".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5E)
【Mayuri】Hole is too tight-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A78)
【Itaru】This is outrageous!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A92)
【Rintaro】Don't make her say that, Retardaru!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA2)
Damn sexual harasser.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB2)
Since Mayuri has a field of flowers for a brain, she doesn't even realize she's being sexually harassed, leaving a horrible end result.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD8)
【Kurisu】The hole is tight... huh. That might not be entirely wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE8)
【Kurisu】Perhaps it has the same problem as SERN's time machine. They can't make the singular points perfectly naked, therefore limiting the sending capacity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B02)
【Itaru】Setting aside Karaage and Bananas, 6 full width or 12 full width characters' worth of data is 12 bytes, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
Thinking about data unit conversion is a really Daru thing to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2C)
【Kurisu】Bytes? Not kilobytes?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B46)
【Itaru】Ohhhh? So Makise-shi's the weak-at-mechanics type?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B56)
【Rintaro】Pff, is that so, Assistant?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B70)
【Kurisu】Sh-shut up. Lately, you don't see things measured in bytes, so I was just making sure...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B80)
By the way, 1 kilobyte is 1024 bytes. 1 byte is 8 bits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9A)
【Itaru】Well, e-mail isn't just comprised of text, though. There's more to it, like the sender's and the receiver's mail addresses, the header, and various othe rthings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAA)
【Itaru】As an estimate, we can send three batches of 12 bytes of data, then? Ah, by the way, I don't know if using a subject or not changes anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBA)
【Rintaro】But I'm pretty certain that converting karaage or bananas into data doesn't come out to a 12 byte size.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BCA)
There's still the question of whether you can even do that in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BDA)
【Rintaro】Since each grain of salt is tiny, it's possible they could be converted to less than 12 bytes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF4)
【Kurisu】So does that mean a large mass would get crushed by super gravity?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C04)
【Rintaro】It might not be mass. Data doesn't have mass.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C1E)
【Kurisu】In any case, since the singular points aren't made naked, the object is forced to pass through the event horizon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2E)
【Kurisu】Inside that event horizon, space and time switch places, causing the subject who arrived at the ring singularity to reach ultra high speed...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C3E)
【Kurisu】The data crushed and destroyed by super gravity is shot out of the black hole....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4E)
【Rintaro】As a jellyman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C68)
【Kurisu】But I don't think having small mass would allow an object to go through. Both have to get out of super gravity, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C78)
【Rintaro】If the hole is too tight, then just increase electron injection.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C92)
【Kurisu】I don't think it's that simple. I mean, SERN should've tested that method. Yet it's been 9 years since they started experiments and they haven't gotten any results.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA2)
【Kurisu】It's not something as simple as increasing the amount of electrons.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB2)
【Rintaro】I-I see...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CCC)
【Kurisu】In the first place, SERN does have a Lifter, but we don't know what substitutes that Lifter in the Microwave Ophone. Then there's the problem of adjustment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CDC)
Certainly...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CEC)
【Rintaro】We don't know what replaces the Lifter, but--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CFC)
【Rintaro】At least we know for certain that by its effect, we've created a path to send up to 36 bytes + α data through the ring singularity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D44)
【Mayuri】I don't get it-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D54)
Mayuri, finished with her karaage, looks for help with a perplexed face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D64)
【Rintaro】You can think of a ring singularity, the entrance to the event horizon, as the gate to the Demon Lord's castle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D7E)
【Kurisu】D-demon Lord...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E30)

<LINE>
<LINE>
An army of hundreds of soldiers attack the heavily fortified Demon Lord's castle gate.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E40)
<LINE>
<LINE>
The soldiers can use the magic called Lifter to force the castle gate open.<LINE>
But they can only open it for a moment before it quickly closes. During that moment, only 12 soldiers can cut through.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E50)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>
The soldiers can only use Lifter magic three times.<LINE>
Those 36 soldiers who entered the gate those three times triumphantly return as the heroes who slew the Demon Lord.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E60)
<LINE>
<LINE>
But the soldiers who could not cut through the gate are seized as prisoners by the Demon Lord's subordinates. They're taken to the castle's prison cells and turned into slimes.<LINE>
The heroes save them after defeating the Demon Lord, but they unfortunately go home as slimes.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E9A)
【Mayuri】So the soldiers who went home as slimes are jellymen, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EAA)
【Rintaro】But there's an exception.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F5C)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>
The hundreds of soldiers can use a forbidden special move, unison, to transform into a Super Soldier with the strength and size of a hundred ordinary soldiers.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6C)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>
The Super Soldier has the power to defeat the Demon Lord alone, but since his body is to big, even if he opens the castle gate with Lifter, he can't pass through.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F7C)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>
And so, deprived of his magic's effectiveness, the weakened Super Soldieris seized by the Demon Lord's underlings, turned into a slime, and goes home as a giant slime without defeating the Demon Lord.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB6)
【Itaru】Wait. What's with that absurd setting?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC6)
【Rintaro】It's to illustrate that the object can't be too big.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FE0)
【Mayuri】I see-. That's really easy to understand-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FFA)
【Kurisu】Really...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002014)
【Itaru】Leaving Okarin's metaphor alone, does this explain the jellyman effect?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002024)
【Rintaro】Hmph. Everything's thanks to Mayuri's hint.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000203E)
【Mayuri】Was Mayushii helpful?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000204E)
【Rintaro】Yeah. Great insight, Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002068)
【Mayuri】Ehhehe-. That's good-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002086)
【Kurisu】But it's still a hypothesis. It hasn't been proven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A0)
【Itaru】How would you prove it? Human experiments like SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020BA)
【Kurisu】If Okabe and Hashida-san volunteer as test subjects, I'd happily experiment on you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D4)
【Itaru】Human experimentation sounds kinda dirty. If you know what I mean.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020EE)
【Itaru】But I refuse. I'd rather be the giver than the receiver.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020FE)
【Rintaro】Same here. No, not in the way he's implying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002118)
【Kurisu】Idiots.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002128)
Kurisu gives us a cold stare, shrugging her shoulders in amazement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002142)
【Kurisu】I've said it before, but the problem is where the Lifter's substitute in that Microwave Ophone is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002152)
【Rintaro】That and one other thing. How come the discharge phenomenon and jellymanification only happen at certain times?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002174)
【Itaru】There are things we don't understand, but since we completed the art of D-mailing, isn't that our <DICT>Final Answer</DICT>?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000218E)
【Mayuri】Sending mail into the past is amazing, isn't it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000219E)
【Itaru】It's not like we can send people to the past firsthand, so it doesn't feel like a time machine, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B8)
【Kurisu】A research facility like SERN has been trying that, but they keep failing. If you go by Titor's predictions, won't it be another 24 years before they complete it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021C8)
I nod when Kurisu sarcastically brings up the subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021D8)
【Rintaro】Physical time travel certainly is impossible for us at the moment. We lack the funds and the facilities available to SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021E8)
【Rintaro】And yet we still brought time travel to realization. We sent data into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002202)
【Kurisu】We should further inspect the Microwave Ophone. We need to understand what's going on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002212)
【Itaru】I want to use D-mail for more various fun things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002222)
【Rintaro】I understand that feeling, but we can't today. If we shake the building again, Mister Braun is sure give out his ultimatum.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002232)
He'll raise the rent or kick us out of the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002242)
【Rintaro】
We can do a detailed examination after tomorrow. But I will declare this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002380)
I step onto the couch and look around at each lab mem.

【Itaru】But it's not the first you know? SERN beat us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002414)
【Kurisu】And you can't even say developed. You just coincidentally made it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002430)
【Rintaro】Hmph, looks like Assistant doesn't know the meaning of the word "serendipity", huh. <DICT>Penicillin</DICT>, %B2SX-rays%B2E, and %B3Sdynamite%B3E, among many others, are inventions born from coincidence!

【Itaru】Wait, that was a Round Table Conference? I didn't know. And it's even the 66th.
