【Kurisu】...What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000820)
【Rintaro】Upset?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000830)
【Kurisu】...yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000840)
Maybe it's because I alienated her right after she finished the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000850)
She was probably only relieved after she had time to fully consider its implications.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000860)
【Rintaro】I came from 5 hours later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087A)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088A)
Kurisu stares at me with a piercing glare--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089A)
【Kurisu】You joking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AA)
Her narrowed eyes make me believe that looks could kill.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BA)
【Rintaro】D-don't stare at me... This isn't what you said at all! "If you say you came from the future, I'll probably believe you"? Like hell you did...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D4)
【Kurisu】Haah? What's with that idiotic line?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E4)
【Rintaro】You said it 5 hours later, you know!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F8)
【Kurisu】Don't make stuff up.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000912)
 "Probably".
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092C)
 I would never utter such logical fluff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000940)
Gh, I'd like to have a word with five hour future Kurisu...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000950)
If it's come to this, then all I can do is quote Kurisu word for word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000960)
【Rintaro】When I told you I successfully time leaped, you said that "Without a doubt, it meant that my theory wasn't wrong. I was happy it succeeded".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000970)
【Rintaro】"I'm the one who improved the Microwave Ophone into the Time Leap Machine in the first place, aren't I?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098A)
【Kurisu】...I-I wouldn't say "aren't I?" like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099A)
【Rintaro】What you want most right now is My Fork.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B4)
【Kurisu】Wait
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C4)
Kurisu's face suddenly turns red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D4)
【Rintaro】It looks like you already have My Spoon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009EE)
【Kurisu】Sh-she even said that? Damn five hour future me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009FE)
She's seriously worried. In any case, it looks like I got her to believe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A18)
【Kurisu】It feels like someone peeked into my heart. And that someone is Okabe of all people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A28)
What does this girl think of me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A42)
【Kurisu】But I think I can believe what you say. Tell me the details.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B58)
I explain everything to Kurisu again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B68)
It's the second time, so I was more organized than before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBA)
【Kurisu】I see... If what you say is true, then this is pretty bad...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCA)
There's still about five hours until Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDA)
We need to work out some sort of counter plan before then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF4)
【Kurisu】Five hour future me said the chronology protection conjecture holds, but I think it's slightly different.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D04)
【Kurisu】That conjecture denies the possibility of time travel from quantum theory because of the danger of disrupting the law of cause and effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1E)
【Kurisu】But in the case of time leaping, no time paradoxes occur in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2E)
Two of me don't exist at the same time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3E)
I can't bring anything with me to the past either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4E)
The only change is the memories stored in my temporal lobe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5E)
Yes, at the very least, time leaping can't cause a Grandfather Paradox.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6E)
【Rintaro】It's the will of the world after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7E)
【Rintaro】It's as if the universe itself is censoring me, correcting any changes I try to make.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8E)
【Kurisu】Then that means time leaping can't save Mayuri. Since anything you do will be fixed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9E)
【Rintaro】...I can't accept that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB8)
【Kurisu】I agree. The will of the world explanation's too unrealistic. I won't support it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC8)
【Rintaro】What about the many worlds interpretation? It's settled if I observe the possibility that Mayuri doesn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE2)
【Kurisu】The many worlds interpretation, huh... It might be related to how Mayuri's means of death keeps changing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF2)
【Kurisu】But mutual observation of superpositioned possible worlds is impossible. How can you observe them?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E02)
【Rintaro】That's because my special ability, Reading Steiner--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1C)
【Kurisu】This guy's hopeless. If I don't do something soon...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2C)
【Rintaro】...there's no other explanation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E46)
【Kurisu】A special ability, you...? Are you, serious, by any chance?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E56)
【Rintaro】I'm not trying to screw with you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E66)
My eye can clearly perceive the world's reorganization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E76)
The D-mail experiments so far have made that clear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E86)
【Kurisu】I don't know anything about special abilities, but I wouldn't rely on such an indefinite thing like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E96)
【Kurisu】You can't control which possibilities you observe. It's unreasonable to expect to arrive at the possibility where Mayuri doesn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA6)
【Rintaro】Wait. The conversation's not going to go anywhere like this. We're good on the interpretation talk, so we should think about what it is we can do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC0)
【Kurisu】Time leaping won't change the result. I already said so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED0)
【Rintaro】Then what should we do!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE0)
【Kurisu】Calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
【Rintaro】Like hell I can calm down! Just how many times do you think I've had to see Mayuri die!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F00)
【Rintaro】Her tragic bloodshed, her final breaths... I've seen them with my own eyes, over and over... and over...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F10)
【Rintaro】I couldn't do anything... but watch...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F20)
I grind my teeth. When I remember those scenes, I'm driven by the frustration to blame everything around me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3A)
【Kurisu】You won't solve anything if you give into your emotions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4A)
【Rintaro】You're only this calm because it doesn't concern you, aren't you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5A)
【Kurisu】...True. I don't know what happens five hours from now. Honestly speaking, it doesn't feel real.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F74)
【Kurisu】But it's not like I don't believe you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F84)
【Kurisu】Okabe, you gotta hang in there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F94)
Kurisu's warm hand touches my arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA4)
She gently pats it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB4)
How American.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC4)
【Rintaro】...Sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD4)
Becoming emotional certainly is meaningless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE4)
I need to calm down like Kurisu said. Calm down...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF4)
【Rintaro】What I don't understand is how the cause changes, yet the result is always the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001004)
【Rintaro】All I can think is that cause and effect are warped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101E)
【Kurisu】Maybe the cause of Mayuri's death isn't "getting shot by Kiryuu Moeka", but something more macro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102E)
【Kurisu】Maybe "because we made a time machine" or possibly "because SERN found out we hacked them".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103E)
【Kurisu】As a result, Mayuri dies. If you think like that, cause and effect aren't warped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104E)
【Rintaro】Can that explain how she got run over when Nae pushed her onto the train tracks?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001068)
【Kurisu】Ah, I see... hmmmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001082)
【Kurisu】But the law of cause and effect is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001092)
【Kurisu】So there must be a "cause" for Mayuri's certain death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A2)
【Rintaro】If we find out that "cause", then maybe we can do something--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010BC)
【Kurisu】Not really.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CC)
【Rintaro】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DC)
【Kurisu】The problem is when that causal event occurred.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
【Kurisu】If it happened a long time ago... then we can't deal with it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FC)
【Rintaro】We have the Time Leap Machine, so I can go back to whenever I had my cell phone, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001116)
【Kurisu】No, you can't. This is just a prediction, but a single use of the Time Leap Machine can only bring you back 48 hours at the longest... I think.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001126)
48 hours... so two days!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001136)
【Rintaro】Why are you saying that just now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001150)
【Kurisu】Just now? I only completed the Time Leap Machine just now, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001160)
That's true...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001170)
【Rintaro】Five hour future you didn't say that either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118A)
【Kurisu】Aah, I see. ...Maybe she couldn't find the time to say it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000119A)
【Rintaro】So, why can I only leap 48 hours?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B4)
【Kurisu】I don't know. It's not like I made the machine with a full understanding of its theory and structure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C4)
【Kurisu】You can do consecutive leaps as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. If it doesn't break for ten years, then you could go back those ten years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D4)
【Kurisu】By simple calculation, that would take 1825 time leaps, so there's quite a big risk, but it's theoretically possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E4)
【Rintaro】Then what's the problem--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011FE)
【Kurisu】A big one. Didn't I say so? As long as the Time Leap Machine exists.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000120E)
【Kurisu】When was that machine completed?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121E)
【Rintaro】...Ah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001238)
【Kurisu】That's right. Just an hour ago. August 13, 2010 at about 2PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001248)
【Kurisu】It didn't exist before then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001258)
【Kurisu】It's impossible to use the machine before 2 today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
【Rintaro】So basically, I can go back--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001278)
Count 48 hours back from 14 o'clock on the 13th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001288)
【Rintaro】To August 11th at 14 o'clock at the furthest!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001298)
Kurisu nods with a serious look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B2)
【Kurisu】Perhaps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C2)
【Rintaro】You can't improve it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D2)
【Kurisu】In the future, perhaps, but it's impossible in this situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E2)
【Kurisu】If we had more precise equipment, used lots of money, and better parts, then we might be able to manage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012FC)
【Kurisu】Even if we did all that, I think SERN would still crush us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130C)
【Kurisu】Neither the future you nor me have time leaped here yet, so it's end of proof, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131C)
So basically--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132C)
【Rintaro】In the end, we can't even do anything!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133C)
【Rintaro】Even though we have the Time Leap Machine, we still can't avoid the fate of SERN killing Mayuri in five hours!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C2)
Then I hear a sound from outside the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D2)
What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E2)
Don't tell me it's Moeka!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F2)
Did she overhear us just now!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001402)
I rush to the window and look to the street below.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E2)
Suzuha's there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F2)
She's hastily picking up her fallen bicycle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001502)
Our eyes meet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001512)
【Rintaro】...her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152C)
Why is she so pale?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153C)
Her lips faintly move.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000154C)
She seemed to whisper something, but I couldn't catch what she said from here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000155C)
【Rintaro】Hey!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FC)
I called out to her, but Suzuha quickly averts her eyes and rushes off on her bicycle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160C)
She's acting strange...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161C)
I smell a conspiracy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162C)
Moeka was SERN's spy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163C)
She approached me by feigning a chance encounter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164C)
In that case, could Suzuha possibly be the same?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165C)
I should doubt everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166C)
In the first place, Suzuha's words also had some suspicious points like Moeka's.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167C)
She doesn't hide her hostility towards Kurisu, and she single-handedly knocked down all of SERN's assassins.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168C)
I wonder if her father really exists.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169C)
Is the John Titor posting on the internet her father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AC)
What's the meaning of the name Barrel Titor?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174C)
Something might be happening--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175C)
My intuition whispers so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176C)
That's why I rush out of the lab immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177C)
【Kurisu】Wait, where are you going!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189A)
I don't think I can catch up to a bicycle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AA)
But I've got a hunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BA)
This development hasn't happened yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CA)
I explained the situation to Kurisu, and Suzuha rushed off somewhere when she overheard it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018DA)
Properly speaking, Suzuha should've stayed at the Braun Tube Workshop until 6:30 today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018EA)
So I've got a feeling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018FA)
That something's happening.
<FILEEND81>
