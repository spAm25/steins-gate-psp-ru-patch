After Mayuri and Daru go home, Kurisu is the only one who stays behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
She's sitting in the development room chair, endlessly twirling a pen in her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000254)
【Rintaro】Just what are you doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000264)
【Kurisu】Thinking. About the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000274)
【Kurisu】I understand how to make it, but just what will happen if we actually use it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000284)
【Rintaro】I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000294)
Is she worried about what happens after she finishes it even though she hasn't started yet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A4)
She sure is confident. Is this the freedom of a genius?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000342)
What'll happen if we use it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000352)
It really doesn't seem like we'll come up with an answer to that soon. That's how our discussion earlier was, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000362)
On the other hand, it seems like a problem of whether she agrees with her own conclusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000372)
That's why I avoid arguing with her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003D6)
【Rintaro】Don't worry so much. Prioritize completing it for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F0)
【Kurisu】So pompous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000040A)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000426)
Kurisu groans a little, and languidly lays herself on the desk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000436)
She's usually so gallant, but when she's thinking, she's pretty sloppy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000446)
This might be Kurisu's natural state.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000456)
【Kurisu】Hey, Okabe--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000466)
【Kurisu】Can I, consult you about something completely unrelated?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000476)
【Rintaro】Don't consult me about something unrelated, but about something related, please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000486)
【Kurisu】You told me before, didn't you? That I could always consult you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000496)
Before...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004A6)
Just what is she talking about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B6)
【Kurisu】I'm, probably hated by my father, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D2)
She sighs such sad words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E2)
I see, it's about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000580)
If she keeps worrying idly like this, it'll hinder the development of the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000590)
In that case, I, Hououin Kyouma, must make her forget about this once and for all, must I not?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A0)
The development of the Time Leap Machine is precisely a project pivoted on Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B0)
It's completely different from her past advisor-like role.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C0)
I need her to get a grip!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000624)
【Rintaro】Fine then. Talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066C)
【Kurisu】Hmhm... you really are pompous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067C)
【Rintaro】Earlier, were you on the phone with your father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000068C)
About four days ago, Kurisu was crying on the bench downstairs while on the phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000069C)
The atmosphere was pretty serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B6)
【Kurisu】...Well, yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C6)
【Kurisu】Since some time ago, it seems like my father started to hate me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D6)
【Kurisu】Before I went to the states, he almost openly avoided me. Even though we're family.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E6)
【Rintaro】How did you act towards your father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F6)
【Kurisu】Long ago, I was daddy's little girl. He was pretty heroic, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000706)
She talks with a self-deriding smile on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000716)
【Kurisu】My father's a physicist, but as a child, I loved hearing difficult conversations. I didn't understand a word of it, but I would always bother my father to talk to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000726)
【Kurisu】I wanted to somehow understand, so I became engrossed in reading physics books since I was little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000736)
Th-that's a genius girl for you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000746)
No, maybe that yearning for her father's love was what gave birth to her genius.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000756)
【Kurisu】Thanks to that, only my math grades at school towered above the rest. I ignored all the other subjects.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000766)
【Kurisu】I read the theses my father wrote, you know? They're not something an elementary student can possibly understand, but I was desperately decoding them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000776)
【Kurisu】I got to the level where I could argue about those theses with my father during late elementary school.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000786)
【Kurisu】I was really happy, and enjoyed being able to talk to my father about physics.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A0)
【Kurisu】And then I would always win those arguments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B0)
【Rintaro】That would make him hate you. Definitely hate you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C0)
A tragedy fitting for a genius girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D0)
I mean, a physicist losing to his elementary school daughter...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EA)
【Kurisu】You really think so?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007FA)
【Rintaro】I don't just think so. That's certainly the cause.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000814)
【Kurisu】He certainly was very proud...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
【Kurisu】Anyway, one day, he suddenly stopped talking to me altogether...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
【Kurisu】Eventually, it got serious with Mama too, and he stopped coming home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
【Kurisu】I really loved my father, so it was a big shock when I felt it was my fault things turned out that way. I even became truant for a period of time...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
【Kurisu】And then Mama recommended I study abroad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000864)
I see, so that's how it happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000874)
【Rintaro】That means you're too superior.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000884)
【Rintaro】So, what do you think about your father now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000894)
【Kurisu】I don't know...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B0)
Kurisu turns down her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C0)
【Rintaro】Your father's in Japan, right? Have you met with him at all?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D0)
【Kurisu】No... We haven't met after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E0)
【Kurisu】That's what we were talking about on the phone earlier. I asked if we could meet, but he yelled don't come...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F0)
Her father's such a pansy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000900)
So saying something like that would really make the strong Kurisu cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000910)
【Kurisu】And, even if we do meet, I don't know what we could talk about...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000920)
【Kurisu】I try my hardest to start talking to him even though he hates me, but he always ignores me....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000930)
【Kurisu】It's so painful. Since I have those memories, I start to think that he'll ignore me again, and then I can't say anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000940)
Trauma, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000950)
【Kurisu】Sniff...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000960)
【Rintaro】Are you crying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000970)
【Kurisu】J-just a little, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000980)
【Rintaro】You still want to reconcile with your father. Correct?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000990)
【Kurisu】I wonder...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A0)
【Rintaro】If you didn't, then you wouldn't have consulted me about him, you wouldn't have said you wanted to meet him, and you wouldn't be crying, would you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B0)
【Kurisu】True...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C0)
【Rintaro】Just be honest with your feelings. "I love Daddy" and stuff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D0)
【Kurisu】I think that's impossible for someone like me, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E0)
【Rintaro】Do you act cutesy with your father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2E)
Kurisu's face gets red as she gets up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3E)
【Kurisu】Wha- I-I don't act!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4E)
【Rintaro】No, you do act. You can't reconcile like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5E)
【Rintaro】You need to strike him straight just the way you are. There's no other solution.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A78)
【Rintaro】There's no point if you don't get your message across. It's meaningless to sugarcoat things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A88)
【Rintaro】If you still can't get him to understand, then your reconciliation won't sprout. Then only time can tell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A98)
【Kurisu】Time? How much?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA8)
【Rintaro】It's not like I have a way of knowing that. I mean, I'm only a year older than you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
【Rintaro】How many years ago did you go to America?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC8)
【Kurisu】Umm... seven years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD8)
【Rintaro】If seven years have passed without any change, then maybe it'll take twice that long.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF2)
【Kurisu】That's right... isn't it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0E)
Kurisu sighs, this time placing her elbow on the desk, listlessly resting her chin in her hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1E)
Did my advice backfire by any chance? It looks like she's terribly depressed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2E)
I fold my arms.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3E)
Hmm, I don't want to see Kurisu like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4E)
【Rintaro】So, when will you go meet him?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B96)
【Kurisu】...Hweh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB2)
Kurisu let's out a silly voice and stares in wonder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCA)
I take out my phone and call up this month's calendar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE2)
【Rintaro】It has to be during summer break, and you have to tell me when you're going early ahead of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF2)
【Kurisu】Wha-wha-wha-what are you talking about!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C02)
【Rintaro】I have plans too. If you tell me suddenly, the our schedules might not match.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C12)
【Kurisu】Nonono, don't tell me you plan to come along!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C22)
【Rintaro】Indeed. You are my assistant. My assistant's worries are my worries. I'll do anything I can so you can work in your best mental condition.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C32)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C42)
Kurisu looks dumbfounded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C52)
What? Did I say something wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C62)
【Kurisu】What's with that? Jokes should also be in moder --
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C72)
【Rintaro】I'm completely serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8C)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9C)
【Rintaro】I'll follow you anywhere as long as it's within Japan. Though it'll be difficult if it's abroad since I don't have a passport or that much money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAC)
【Kurisu】Okabe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBC)
【Rintaro】If you're alone with your father, you won't know what to talk about, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
【Kurisu】Yeah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDC)
【Rintaro】So if I come along, there won't be a problem. I, Hououin Kyouma, will sense the mood and supply splendid subject matter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF6)
【Kurisu】...pfft
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D06)
【Rintaro】Why are you laughing!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D16)
【Kurisu】Come on, you of all people can't sense the mood at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D26)
【Rintaro】Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D36)
That, that's true...! No, rather, that's my strong point. Mad scientists must be self-righteous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D50)
【Kurisu】But thanks... I never thought that you'd go that far to say those things for me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6A)
【Kurisu】I-it's not like I'm happy about that or anything!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7A)
【Kurisu】Honestly, it troubles me that you can be a good guy at times!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8A)
What troubles her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9A)
Or rather, why did she suddenly snap? Shouldn't she be apologizing to me instead?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB4)
【Kurisu】Hey, Okabe. I really can... take you up on that offer, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC4)
【Rintaro】Of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD4)
【Kurisu】Then, once we're done with the Microwave Ophone's improvements--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEE)
【Kurisu】Come with me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFE)
【Rintaro】You can count on me. So, where's your father now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0E)
【Kurisu】Aomori.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1E)
【Rintaro】Aomorii!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2E)
【Kurisu】My father lives there now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3E)
That's farther than expected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E58)
【Kurisu】Wh-what? You're not going to back out are you!? Because it's already been decided. I'm taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E68)
【Rintaro】...a-as you wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E78)
Well, if promising to go to Aomori will make Kurisu work her hardest at the Time Leap Machine, it's a small price to pay.
