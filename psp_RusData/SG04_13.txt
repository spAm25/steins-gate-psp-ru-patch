I diligently did my laundry at a laundromat in the morning, so when I return to the lab just past noon, Daru, Mayuri, and Kurisu are all assembled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B6)
【Rintaro】Thanks for coming out here even though it's Saturday. You are all great lab mems of inquisitive minds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D0)
【Kurisu】Yeah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E0)
Kurisu sighs deeply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F0)
【Kurisu】I can't believe it's the height of summer, but instead of going on vacation, I'm stuck in this sauna talking with a bunch of pervert creeps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0A)
【Kurisu】Where did I go wrong...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1A)
She's really giving us a verbal beatdown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
【Rintaro】Wipe your tears, you experiment loving girl without a single friend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A44)
【Kurisu】I, I wasn't crying!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5E)
【Kurisu】Anyway, you're the one who mailed me to come here, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6E)
【Rintaro】Indeed, it was I. But the one who faithfully abided by that mail and punctually arrived at the lab, was you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7E)
【Mayuri】You know, Chris-chan is actually a very obedient and diligent girl. That's what Mayushii thinks♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A96)
Mayuri smiles and murmurs as she eats some nuggets from <DICT>McD's</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA6)
【Mayuri】Mayushii thinks Chris-chan is so adorable like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC0)
【Kurisu】Eh, wha...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADA)
【Kurisu】How can this girl say something like that while eating a nugget...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEA)
It's not something to be worried about. That's just how Mayuri is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFA)
I've been with her for a long time, so I'm used to it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B12)
【Itaru】A yuri <DICT>flag</DICT>, huh. I get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2C)
【Kurisu】Please unget it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3C)
【Mayuri】Here, Chris-chan, I'll give you a nugget, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4C)
【Kurisu】Th-thanks...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C64)
While listening to the heartwarming conversation, I place my laundry on the table, when--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7E)
【Kurisu】Don't put that there. That's filthy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9A)
【Rintaro】I just washed them!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB4)
【Kurisu】Like I care. You lack delicacy if you can just put your laundry with your underwear in magnificent display right in front of a girl your age.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC4)
【Rintaro】If you're that interested in my underwear, then just say so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDE)
【Kurisu】Wh-wha...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEE)
【Kurisu】I'm not interested at all...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFE)
【Mayuri】Now, now, you two-. No more saying underwear, underwear-. Mayushii's trying to eat here, okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0E)
【Itaru】You say that, but you're still putting nuggets to your mouth...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1E)
【Rintaro】Don't interrupt me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E80)
I have to put my laundry in the changing room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F56)
【Rintaro】I talked to Daru yesterday, but I noticed something about the results of our serial experiments!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F66)
【Rintaro】D-mails have too much of an uncertain factor. As a result, they have no guarantee.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F80)
【Kurisu】There's no helping it, right? After all, you are entrusting the result to how the receiving party responds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F90)
【Kurisu】But conversely, if you can psychoanalyze the other party's character, you might be able to better manipulate them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAA)
【Kurisu】With that psychological element in mind, it might be impossible for Hououin Kyoumunderwear, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBA)
【Itaru】Makise-shi, do you just want to say underwear?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCA)
【Rintaro】Putting underwear aside, it's a fact that D-mails still feel like a gamble.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDA)
I want more certainty so I can expose the conspiracies of the Organization and SERN, guiding chaos to the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEA)
【Rintaro】And that, ladies and gentlemen gathered here today, is the fact of the matter. The topic of today's round table conference is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104E)
【Itaru】It's become another unexpected round table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105E)
【Kurisu】If you want a round-table conference that much, at least go buy a round table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106E)
【Mayuri】That's not it, Chris-chan. You know, Okarin said it before, but the round table exists in everyone's hearts-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107E)
【Kurisu】Mayuri-san, you're really a pure girl... But you shouldn't take everything Okabe says seriously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108E)
【Mayuri】Really-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109E)
【Rintaro】The definition of a round table doesn't matter now. More importantly, the topic--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AE)
【Rintaro】Is that, instead of using D-mails, I want to explore for a solution to physical time travel like SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001172)
【Kurisu】Don't be ridiculous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001182)
Prompt answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001192)
And she's glaring at me even sharper than she did during the whole underwear thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A2)
【Kurisu】SERN's been using such large-scale equipment, for more than nine years, and yet they still haven't succeeded, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B2)
【Kurisu】It's not something we can possibly hope to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CC)
【Mayuri】You'll become a GelOkarin-. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011EE)
【Itaru】Doesn't that sound like <DICT>Gero Froggy</DICT>? Why'd they get popular, anyway?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001208)
【Kurisu】No, this isn't a laughing matter...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001218)
【Rintaro】Isn't it too early to give up? Haven't we already succeeded with D-mail, a first in all of human history?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001232)
【Itaru】But we're not the first. SERN did it before us, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001296)
【Rintaro】Human history's first time-crossing mail. We who have achieved it know not the meaning of the word "impossible"!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A6)
【Kurisu】Such baseless confidence. Anyway, wasn't it just a coincidence that you could use D-mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B6)
【Kurisu】We still haven't figured out what replaces the lifter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C6)
【Rintaro】Don't we just need to figure it out?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138A)
【Kurisu】It's all useless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139A)
【Kurisu】How do you deal with a problem that not even SERN can figure out?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AA)
【Kurisu】If you can't set the local field, then you won't know where you'll leap to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C4)
【Itaru】I'll pass on leaping into the nothingness of space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
Local field setting certainly is a troubling problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
If you can't tell where you'll leap, there's no meaning to time travel at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001448)
【Rintaro】No, wait a sec.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001458)
【Rintaro】D-mails don't have local field settings. Yet they still arrive at their destinations properly. How do you explain that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001468)
【Kurisu】...Now that you mention it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001478)
【Itaru】Doesn't it arrive properly since you set the mail address?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001488)
【Kurisu】Is that so...? I don't think a phone signal can be received from millions of kilometers away, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001498)
【Mayuri】Mayushii thinks that maybe the signals are somewhere that can't be reached-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151A)
I stare at my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001598)
【Rintaro】Or maybe cellphones already have black holes and <DICT>white hole</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A8)
【Kurisu】You shouldn't speculate. You have zero basis for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
【Rintaro】Is it possible that it forms a wormhole?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
【Kurisu】No wormholes have ever been confirmed to exist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
I groan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E8)
Kurisu and Daru say no more about this inexplicable situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F8)
Only Mayuri smiles. No doubt she doesn't understand and is just smiling for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001608)
【Rintaro】In any case, the cold, hard truth is that D-mails arrive in the past. We're leading SERN in that regard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001618)
【Rintaro】Now, for time travel, could we possibly apply the same mechanism as D-mails?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001628)
【Itaru】But with D-mails, you can only send 36 bytes + α of data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001638)
【Itaru】It's seriously impossible to just roll up a person and physically transfer them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001648)
SERN's probably having a hard time with that too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170C)
【Kurisu】If you want to become GelOkarin, I'm not stopping you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001726)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C4)
I get goosebumps when I recall the tragic fate of the researchers in the Jellyman's Report.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D4)
The ring singularity of a Kerr black hole. Super gravitational space-time distortion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E4)
If you can adjust the volume of electron injection from the lifter, you might be able to make the ring singularities naked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F4)
But that adjustment is such a challenge that even SERN is having a hard time with it. Even if we do locate the lifter's replacement, it's not a problem we can solve quickly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001804)
Meaning that at present, we can only send a mere 35 bytes+α of data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001814)
I wonder what size a human body is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182C)
I've got a feeling it's no less than an <DICT>exa</DICT> byte...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189A)
【Kurisu】It's best if we don't think about physical transfer for now. Even just data time travel is an amazing feat, so we should just be patient with that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AA)
Data time travel... huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190E)
【Rintaro】That's a backwards utterance unthinkable for researchers who seek the truth of the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191E)
【Kurisu】I'm telling you to know your limits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192E)
【Kurisu】If you're going to seek the truth, you need to have the appropriate brains, equipment, and funding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193E)
【Kurisu】With such an impoverished circle, your high ambitions don't mean much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194E)
【Kurisu】I thought about it before, but we should bring the Microwave Ophone to a proper research institution and entrust it to a specialist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195E)
【Kurisu】Since SERN is keeping their time machine research top secret, if we just make an official announcement, it'll be helpful for the future of mankind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196E)
【Rintaro】...If we make an official announcement, the "Organization's" guys will become aware of my existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197E)
【Kurisu】You know...! I'm speaking seriously here. This isn't the time for jok--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198E)
【Rintaro】And we've also hacked SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199E)
【Rintaro】Those guys are a heartless bunch who'd go so far as to do human experimentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AE)
【Rintaro】If we officially announce the Microwave Ophone (Temp), we might be erased.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A72)
【Kurisu】...Are you watching too many movies?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A82)
【Rintaro】The name "Committee of 300" appeared in actual SERN documents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A9C)
【Kurisu】Yeah, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AAC)
Kurisu's tone of voice weakens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ABC)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's kinda scared-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACC)
【Itaru】If our hacking got found out, then we'd seriously get erased. I didn't make any mistakes that would give us away, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADC)
【Rintaro】Also, this is the most important problem, but--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEC)
I lower my voice, and look seriously at their three faces.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B50)
【Rintaro】If we make an official announcement, we won't be able to send D-mails as we please anymore, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B60)
【Kurisu】Why, you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B70)
【Rintaro】Fuhahaha! Like hell I'd give up such a device of dreams so easily!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B80)
【Rintaro】I am Hououin Kyouma! The insane mad scientist who rules space-time! What I wish for, yes, is chaos...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B90)
【Kurisu】This guy's hopeless. If I don't do something soon...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8C)
【Itaru】Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C9C)
【Rintaro】Hm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CAC)
【Mayuri】Hwe?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC6)
【Kurisu】Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD6)
Everything instantly freezes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE6)
【Rintaro】Christina, are you an @channe--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D12)
【Kurisu】Shutup don't say any more that's not it okay!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D2C)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3C)
Kurisu gives me her sharpest dagger eyes yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4C)
So cold my spine freezes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5C)
I nod and swallow my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DCA)
【Rintaro】Th-that reminds me, Daru. Did you make any progress on hacking into SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE6)
He did say it would take a little time to learn IBN 5100 use, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF6)
I confirmed that Daru came to the lab every day, doing something with his computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E06)
His monitor was always displaying a program, and he would keep checking on it and tamper with it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E16)
【Itaru】Yeah, right now I'm fishing through tons of SERN's data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E26)
【Itaru】Even if I translated and read them all, it would take years. Whenever I found something important, I transferred it to Makise-shi though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E36)
【Itaru】Well, basically, it's not something I can do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E46)
【Itaru】Now I've got SERN in the palm of my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E56)
【Rintaro】I'm completely grateful that you're my ally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E66)
Your weakness to seduction is your one fly in the ointment, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E76)
【Rintaro】So, Christina. Your report on the translation situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E86)
【Kurisu】...Can you quit it with your theatrical speech? That's kind of vexing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F82)
【Mayuri】Vex☆
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F92)
For some reason, Mayuri takes a cute, idol-like pose and smiles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA2)
【Mayuri】Chris-chan, you know, I'll tell you something as Okarin's childhood friend-, you get used to Okarin's way of talking♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB2)
【Kurisu】I just hope that doesn't take ten years...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC2)
【Rintaro】So, you mean you want to stay with me for ten years? In other words, to work in this lab for the rest of your life--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD2)
【Kurisu】Sarcasm, man. Sarcasm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FE2)
【Rintaro】...I-I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000204A)
【Rintaro】So, report quickly, Christina. If you don't, then I'll call you a "channer"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DE)
【Kurisu】I said that's not it, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020EE)
She's scowling again. My spine chills again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002156)
【Kurisu】I did try to do some translation, but at present, no new information on time machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002166)
【Kurisu】SERN really is struggling to come up with a solution.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002176)
Maybe they'll have to wait another 24 years like Titor said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002186)
【Rintaro】Daru, any other results?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002196)
【Itaru】Not a result, but it looks like SERN's in the middle of experimenting, so the LHC's at full operation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A6)
【Itaru】I'm trying to see if I can cut in and maybe secretly use it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B6)
【Kurisu】No way...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021C6)
Kurisu's stunned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021D6)
Well, I'm surprised too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021E6)
【Mayuri】Isn't that amazing-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021F6)
【Kurisu】It's not amazing. It's downright outrageous...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002206)
【Kurisu】Supah hakah, you don't afraid of anything...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002302)
【Rintaro】Hey, Christina. You doing that on purpose?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000231C)
【Kurisu】Ugh... d-doing what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000233A)
So she is an @channeler. No doubt about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023A2)
【Itaru】But, well, it does seem like we can use it, but we don't have much use for it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B2)
【Rintaro】The strategy's going well, huh. When do we enter the third stage?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C2)
【Itaru】What's the third stage?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D2)
【Rintaro】SERN's top secret, forbidden domain. Obviously, we're going to open up the darkness hidden inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E2)
【Itaru】In Japanese please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F2)
【Rintaro】There's a database constructed of IBN 5100's, right? I'm asking if you've already commenced hacking there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002402)
Daru frowns at my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002412)
【Itaru】Yeah, I said that was impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002438)
【Rintaro】Can't you do something as long as we have the IBN 5100!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002448)
【Itaru】I could. But conversely speaking, that's exactly why I can't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000250C)
【Rintaro】Hmm...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025BC)
This feeling again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025CC)
The conversation isn't lining up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002630)
【Rintaro】I got an IBN 5100, didn't I? You haven't touched it yet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000264A)
【Itaru】Huh? You got one? When?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000265A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000266A)
Puzzled, I look at Kurisu and Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000267A)
Mayuri tilts her head with a puzzled look, like always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000268A)
Kurisu meets my glance and shrugs her shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A4)
【Kurisu】I never heard that you got one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026BE)
【Rintaro】Impossible...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026CE)
That just can't be!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002744)
I step into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002754)
The IBN 5100 I borrowed from Yanabayashi Shrine should be on the shelf inside. It's in a cardboard box, and it weighs 25kg, a weight hard to carry by a single person--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002764)
【Rintaro】...it's gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002774)
It doesn't exist where I thought I left it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B0)
【Rintaro】...IBN 5100! I placed you right here. Where did you disappear to!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C0)
Everyone looks at me in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D0)
【Rintaro】What's with those pigeon-potshot-with-peashooter faces!? The legendary PC dedicated at Yanabayashi Shrine!! You guys know about it, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E0)
【Mayuri】I don't know about it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FA)
【Itaru】Dedicated at Yanabayashi Shrine? That's retarded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002914)
【Kurisu】You sure you didn't hallucinate? It's hot these days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002924)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C6)
I sink into helplessness like quicksand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D6)
Without the IBN 5100, we can't hack that database!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A74)
Just who did it? Who took it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A84)
The Organization? SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A94)
SERN is a possibility. Maybe they noticed our hacking and stole the IBN 5100 from the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA4)
No, no, no.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB4)
Even if they could steal the IBN 5100 from the lab, they can't steal Mayuri and Daru's memories of it...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC4)
Just what happened...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B8A)
Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BA8)
Maybe I should check Moeka right this instant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC6)
Someone besides Moeka could have taken it away....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE4)
I try considering that possibility.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C02)
And the only name I could come up with--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C20)
【Rintaro】Don't tell me, John Titor!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C3E)
【Rintaro】That's it, Titor's objective was to obtain an IBN 5100! I've already contacted him several times. But how did he get my personal information!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F16)
I sent that mail to Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F26)
I don't know if I'll get a response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F36)
Why am I sending her a mail like this in the first place...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F46)
The reason's obvious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F56)
I want to test that woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F66)
If it's an inside crime, then Moeka's the most suspicious one with her strange attachment to the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F76)
I wait a while, but no reply comes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F86)
Anyway, even if Moeka were the culprit, she wouldn't honestly admit it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FCE)
【Kurisu】Calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FE8)
【Kurisu】You don't have to arrange your thoughts, just slowly say whatever comes to mind. You can organize your thoughts later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FF8)
【Rintaro】Ah, ahhh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003008)
I wipe of my sweat with a handkerchief, and explain fundamental knowledge on the IBN 5100 and how I came to obtain one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000301C)
When I groan if I should send a mail, Kurisu chides me to calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000302C)
To be chided by a younger high school girl... you dare make a fool of Hououin Kyouma...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000303C)
Halfway serious, I explain fundamental knowledge on the IBN 5100 and how I came to obtain one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030DE)
During that time, I also send Moeka a confirmation mail.
