#WRITE(PTR, $000003A0)
I leaned against the wall, hugging both knees, tasting a long, long void.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B0)
How much time has passed since Mayuri died?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C0)
I didn't go to the vigil, nor the funeral.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003D0)
There's no way I could go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003E0)
Because it's almost like I killed her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F0)
I don't want to see anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000400)
I don't want to meet anyone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000410)
Even breathing is bothersome.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000420)
But, I have no choice but to face both this emptiness and this heartrending guilt, and accept what I have done.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000430)
That's my current obligation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000440)
What I must do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B6)
And then, I hear the sound of someone pulling the curtain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000582)
Light shines in from the lounge next door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000592)
With her back to that light stands a woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005EA)
I could tell from the silhouette that it's Kurisu, but I immediately cover my face and block out the noise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005FA)
【Kurisu】Okabe. It's already been three days, so will you at least eat something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000061A)
【Kurisu】You knew, didn't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000062A)
【Kurisu】That, on that day, Mayuri would die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000063A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000064A)
【Kurisu】Why don't you time leap?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065A)
【Kurisu】You wouldn't hesitate to use the Time Leap Machine to save Mayuri. That's what I hypothesized.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066A)
【Kurisu】Anyway, what happened to your plan to change Urushibara-san's gender to male and take back the IBN 5100?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067A)
【Kurisu】You were so focused on carrying out that plan to save Mayuri. Then, why--?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000068A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000069A)
【Kurisu】Wait, by any chance, did you already get back the IBN 5100, and this is after you changed world lines?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006AA)
【Kurisu】And what's left here is Okabe Rintaro's remains. Left behind. And now this is the parallel world that continues from the future where Mayuri wasn't saved--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006BA)
【Rintaro】...I didn't get back the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006CA)
It might be because I haven't spoken in three days, but my voice was hoarse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DA)
【Kurisu】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EA)
【Rintaro】...I couldn't change Lukako back into a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FA)
【Rintaro】That's why I accepted this fate...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070A)
No, again, I chose words that make my actions seem ambiguous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071A)
【Rintaro】I... let Mayuri die...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072A)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000073A)
Kurisu catches her breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074A)
Why did I confess?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075A)
It's not something I should confess so easily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076A)
Almost like calling myself a murderer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077A)
It should've been Lukako's and my secret.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000078A)
And yet, I--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000079A)
Do I want to be criticized, to put myself at ease?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007AA)
At this rate, it seems like it's a lot more preferable to be criticized by someone than to keep living with the pain of keeping it bottled up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007BA)
And, if that someone is Kurisu, I'm sure she would tell me exactly what's on her mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007CA)
Like, 'You're the worst.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007DA)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EA)
【Kurisu】...will you eat?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000876)
Kurisu didn't criticize me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000886)
【Kurisu】If you're okay with cup noodles, I can prepare that. Or do you want to go buy something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000896)
【Rintaro】Blame me. Scold me for killing Mayuri...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B0)
【Kurisu】I do want to scold you, but let's stop. It doesn't look like I need to say anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C0)
【Kurisu】Returning to the past and bending the laws of causality might be an impertinent act, after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D0)
【Kurisu】More importantly...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008EA)
【Kurisu】There's no way that I could scold you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008FA)
【Kurisu】You've been fighting all alone this whole time as the only existence outside the confines of cause and effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090A)
【Kurisu】So no one else can understand your pain but you--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091A)
【Kurisu】No one else but you can understand the meaning of your choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092A)
【Kurisu】There's no way I can blame you when I haven't time leaped even once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093A)
【Rintaro】...How can you be so understanding?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000094A)
I strongly grasp my knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000095A)
【Kurisu】There's no way I could understand. When you decided to save Mayuri by time leaping, you must've made a resolve that nobody else could understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000974)
【Kurisu】So accept what you've done.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000984)
【Kurisu】If you do that, then you'll never forget the meaning of what you've done.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000994)
So, in other words, Kurisu's telling me to suffer by myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A4)
What a sadistic woman...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BE)
【Kurisu】But...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D8)
【Kurisu】You should take responsibility for the other girl you saved with your choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009EC)
【Kurisu】Mayuri is dead.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A06)
 It's disappointing- no, disappointing isn't sad enough a word, but anyway, Mayuri is no more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1A)
【Kurisu】You couldn't oppose the world's convergence, the world's will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
【Kurisu】But, that girl is still alive. Thanks to you, she's still alive, as a girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A44)
【Kurisu】And I think she's suffering all alone, just like you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A54)
【Kurisu】The only one who can understand her suffering is you, Okabe, her "accomplice", right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A64)
【Rintaro】Accomplice...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7A)
The woman named Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8A)
Is truly harsh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9A)
Lukako's image floats through my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAA)
She used to be a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBA)
But now she's a woman. And from now on, she'll live as a woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCA)
The one who chose that future for Lukako is, without a doubt, me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDA)
When I imagine her frail smile, I feel like a spring has sprung in the frozen soil of my dry heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEA)
I can't bear to lose Lukako after sacrificing Mayuri...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFA)
In that case, what I can do is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
【Rintaro】Thank you, Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1A)
【Rintaro】I'm glad I talked with you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5C)
I walk onto the shrine's grounds and almost feel the heat on my skin slowly lower.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6C)
The large tree next to the main building. Its branches coated with luscious leaves sway in the gentle breeze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7C)
These silently still grounds seem slightly cooler than the crowded buildings in front of the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8C)
We might also be near the Kanda River.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9C)
It's devoid of people, as usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAC)
I casually advance towards the offertory box, absentmindedly gazing at the shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBC)
I wonder if Lukako's home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCC)
Her family should be here too. How to call for her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDC)
As I think this, the wind suddenly lets up, and the sound of trees rustling stops for a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEC)
And in it's place, I hear sobbing deep within.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFC)
Sounds like it's behind the main building.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0C)
I gain some confidence, and slowly head towards the voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E68)
【Luka】Uh... sniff...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E78)
Subduing her voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E88)
Hugging her knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E98)
Holding "Samidare".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA8)
Lukako was there, crying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB8)
【Rintaro】Lukako...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC8)
【Luka】...Okabe, san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED8)
Lukako turns her wet eyes towards me when she notices me, but immediately afterwards, buries her face in her knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE8)
And then her shoulders start shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF8)
【Luka】Yesterday... I went to Mayuri-chan's funeral...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
【Luka】Everyone cried. I didn't know Mayuri-chan was loved by so many people...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F18)
【Luka】Of course, I loved Mayuri-chan too...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F28)
【Luka】I'm not really good with strangers, but Mayuri-chan would still brightly talk to me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F38)
【Luka】She was the friend I loved the most...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F48)
I lost the words I was about to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F58)
All I could do was sit silently next to Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F68)
【Luka】But still, why, Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F78)
【Luka】Why... are we... still alive?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F88)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
【Luka】Even though Mayuri-chan died...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA8)
【Luka】Now, while I'm still a girl...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB8)
Since she somehow got back her memories from when she was a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC8)
Now, Lukako is beginning to have gender identity issues.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD8)
I don't know that feeling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE8)
Just as Kurisu said, Lukako is also isolated outside the confines of cause and effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF8)
【Luka】It just doesn't feel right... for me to keep living like this...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001008)
【Rintaro】That's not true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001018)
Even though I try to cheer her up with those careless words, Lukako keeps shaking her head in denial.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001028)
【Luka】Okabe-san, is there any way at all to save Mayuri-chan...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001038)
【Rintaro】...It's useless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001048)
【Luka】No way...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AC)
Lukako stands up while crying and pleads with me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010BC)
【Luka】Let's keep thinking... I'll do anything if it'll save Mayuri-chan...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CC)
【Luka】I heard from Mayuri-chan before... that Okabe-san made a device that goes back in time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DC)
Is she talking about the Time Leap Machine...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
【Luka】If we use that--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FC)
【Rintaro】It's useless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000110C)
【Luka】If we go back in time, I'm sure we'll find a way...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111C)
【Rintaro】There is... no way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000112C)
I declare so while clenching my fist and hanging my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000113C)
【Rintaro】It may be cruel, but all we can do is accept Mayuri's death, and keep on living.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001156)
【Luka】You can't give up...! Why are you giving up? Aren't you sad at all that Mayuri-chan died?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001166)
【Rintaro】...In any case, there is no way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001176)
【Luka】No, I don't want Mayuri-chan to die...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001186)
【Rintaro】Lukako!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A0)
Lukako's whole body winces when I grab her shoulder and raise my voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B0)
【Rintaro】Did you... really think I gave up that easily?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C0)
【Luka】Okabe...san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D0)
【Rintaro】She was my very important childhood friend... There's no way I could have given up on her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E0)
【Rintaro】I thought. I thought so much I could die, I struggled, and I struggled, and tried any means I thought could help...! How many times do you think I've gone back in time...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F0)
【Rintaro】But it was all useless... The world just wants her dead. No matter how I try to avoid it, the world snatches Mayuri away just to laugh at me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001200)
【Rintaro】To save Mayuri, I've sacrificed other people's memories. I did so to save Mayuri, no matter whom I hurt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001210)
【Rintaro】But that's my limit...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001220)
【Rintaro】It's already useless...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001230)
There is a way. There are still ways to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001240)
But I chose none of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
Theoretically, it's not impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001260)
But, it's impossible, for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127A)
【Luka】...I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000128A)
【Luka】I didn't think even stop to think... about Okabe-san's feelings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012AA)
【Luka】But, there's no way, that it's useless... Isn't there still one more way left...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012BA)
【Luka】If you turn me back into a guy--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CA)
【Rintaro】That's no good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DA)
If we do that, then this choice will have no meaning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EA)
I chose Lukako instead of Mayuri. That's how it is, if you think about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001304)
【Luka】Please, Okabe-san. I don't want to be a girl so badly that I'd sacrifice Mayuri-chan...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001314)
【Luka】Please, let me save Mayuri-chan...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001324)
【Rintaro】I won't turn you back into a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133E)
【Luka】Why...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000134E)
【Luka】Why won't you...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000135E)
【Rintaro】That's what I chose. I can't keep on hurting people to feed my ego.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000136E)
【Rintaro】Besides, even if we go back to the original world line, it's not certain we can avoid Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137E)
【Rintaro】I... won't sacrifice anyone's memories... I won't sacrifice your memories... for just a small chance like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138E)
【Rintaro】So that's enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139E)
【Luka】Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AE)
【Luka】But, this is unforgivable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C8)
【Luka】I don't... an existence like me, doesn't deserve to live...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D8)
【Luka】How can I keep living like this... knowing that me being a girl contributed to Mayuri's death...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E8)
【Luka】That's too heavy a burden... for me to bear...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F8)
【Luka】So, why...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001408)
【Luka】Why didn't you send the mail to my mom's pager 18 years ago...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001418)
【Luka】Why didn't you chose Mayuri-chan... but me...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001428)
【Rintaro】You have nothing to feel indebted about. Everything is my choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001438)
【Rintaro】The one who killed Mayuri is me. So, all the guilt hangs on me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001448)
I hold the god-rivaling power known as the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001458)
I chose Mayuri's Death out of the infinite futures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001468)
And so, I must naturally carry the responsibility equal to the gods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001478)
【Rintaro】And, I thought I wanted you to be happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001492)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A2)
【Luka】Happy? How can I possibly be happy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
【Luka】When Mayuri died because of me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
【Rintaro】It wasn't because of you. Please don't say that again. You might be sad now, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D2)
【Rintaro】I want you to keep going forward, and live enough for Mayuri too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EC)
【Luka】No way... I don't want that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014FC)
Lukako clings to my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150C)
She focuses on me without wiping her tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151C)
【Luka】In that case... In that case, I want to help bear Okabe's burden together...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152C)
【Rintaro】Bear... together? What nonsense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153C)
【Rintaro】I am a human outside of the confines of cause and effect, the human that chose to let Mayuri die--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000154C)
【Luka】Then me too... I'll go outside the confines of cause and effect...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000155C)
【Luka】I regained the memories of my time as a guy, so doesn't that mean I'm already outside...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156C)
【Luka】I also know that I'm living as a woman in exchange for Mayuri's fate, too...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000157C)
【Luka】We're accomplices...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158C)
Kurisu said the same thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159C)
Luka and I are accomplices.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B6)
【Luka】This sadness. And this indebtedness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C6)
【Luka】I want the two of us to embrace them, so we don't forget...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D6)
The two of us are existences isolated outside the confines of cause and effect, where nobody else can understand us.

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E6)
That's why--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F6)
【Rintaro】Yeah, I understand...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001606)
I strongly embrace Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001616)
【Rintaro】Let's bear our burden, together...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001626)
【Rintaro】Let's live... without forgetting this memory, together...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001640)
【Luka】Can I stay by you, forever?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001650)
【Luka】Because... I love you, Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001660)
【Luka】I might be betraying Mayuri-chan, but... I want to be together forever...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001670)
【Rintaro】Of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001680)
We both bear the same burden of indebtedness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001690)
From now on, we press our shoulders together, accepting Mayuri's death, yet still living.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E2)
After that, we passed the time sitting down together until the sky turned the color of dusk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F2)
We didn't really do anything, and we didn't really talk about anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001802)
Lukako rests her head on my shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001812)
I embraced her shoulder, and feel her breathing near me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001822)
We just kept silently gazing at the sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001832)
And in our hearts, we prayed for Mayuri's happiness in the afterlife.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001842)
I'm sorry, Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001852)
I'm sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186C)
【Luka】Hey, Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187C)
Lukako raises her head and breaks the silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000188C)
I could feel some sort of resolution emanating from her expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189C)
【Luka】There's still one thing that I should have done for Mayuri-chan that I left undone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AC)
【Luka】Because of that, I made a sad memory for Mayuri-chan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BC)
【Rintaro】Something left undone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CC)
【Luka】...Cosplay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018DC)
Oh, that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018EC)
These last few weeks, Mayuri was constantly asking Lukako to wear the costumes she made for her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018FC)
But, Lukako would always reject her, because it's too embarrassing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190C)
I remember Mayuri on the day she died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A08)
【Mayuri】I think it would really fit Luka-chan if she cosplayed Kirari-chan-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A18)
【Mayuri】Luka-chan is so cute, she makes Mayushii's heart throb, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A44)
【Mayuri】Luka-chan's usually a very obedient girl, right-? She rarely gives her own opinion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A54)
【Mayuri】When you cosplay, your "usual" self becomes "another" self.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A64)
【Mayuri】That's why I think that if Luka-chan cosplays once, even if it's embarrassing at first, she'll definitely find a new Luka-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A74)
【Mayuri】And when that happens, she'll become more assertive than before, and maybe even dominate Okarin in the butt-. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADE)
Even on that day, Mayuri would only talk about Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEE)
I stood her up on my promise to bring Lukako to ComiMa, and made her lonely, even though she got over it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AFE)
Mayuri wanted to get Lukako to cosplay from the bottom of her heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0E)
【Luka】Could that machine that goes back in time... go back to that day?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B1E)
【Rintaro】Go back?' You mean, you will...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2E)
Lukako nods firmly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B3E)
【Rintaro】Are you serious?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B4E)
Nobody has used the Time Leap Machine except me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B5E)
At present, it's never failed, but if something does happen, it might not be reversible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6E)
In SERN's time machine experiments, the test subjects turned into jellymen. Same may happen, and there's a chance that her memories break in the process.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7E)
【Rintaro】It's too dangerous. So far, only I have used it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B8E)
【Luka】Please...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA8)
【Luka】At the very least, I want Mayuri-chan to leave with a smile...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB8)
【Luka】Because I wasn't able to do anything for her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC8)
【Rintaro】But if we go there, you're won't be able to handle all the otaku.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD8)
【Luka】I am a bit scared after all... But... I never said that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF2)
【Luka】Besides that, I want to really be the same as Okabe-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C02)
【Luka】If I use that device... I'll have completely gone outside the confines of cause and effect, won't I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C12)
【Luka】And then I can bear the same feelings as Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C22)
【Luka】So please...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C32)
That innocent emotion warms my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C42)
Lukako is thinking about me and Mayuri from the bottom of her heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C52)
In the end, I couldn't say no to those feelings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D80)
When we got back to the lab, neither Daru nor Kurisu were there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D90)
Even though just a few days ago, Mayuri, Kurisu, Daru, and I, along with the others were spending our time noisily here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA0)
With Mayuri gone, it seems like only dreams of those days are left behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB0)
Now, only loneliness floats through the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC0)
But without expressing those feelings, I entered the experiment room with Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E60)
Luckily, the CRT downstairs was turned on, so we could immediately begin time leaping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E70)
【Rintaro】What time will you jump to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB8)
【Luka】...The morning of that day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC8)
【Luka】If I jump to the day before, I don't think I would be mentally stable enough to accept it as reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED8)
【Luka】So please...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE8)
Meaning she's chosen the very day to cosplay with a smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF8)
But to jump to that day would take at least three jumps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F08)
I don't know if we can successfully get her to the 15th...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F18)
I'm worried, but Lukako's will doesn't waver.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F28)
【Rintaro】Get in touch with me after you've leaped safely. Then I'm sure I'd take you to where Mayuri is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F38)
【Luka】Okay...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F48)
I cover Lukako's head with the headgear attached to the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F58)
Her body is obviously shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F68)
That's understandable, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F78)
Even I'm starting to get so tense my heart seems like it'll explode.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F88)
The is the first experiment where someone besides me will use the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F98)
I can't stop thinking about what would happen if we fail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA8)
【Rintaro】Don't worry. Your brain will hurt a bit, but it'll settle down in a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC2)
【Luka】O, Okay...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD2)
【Rintaro】Even if you get to the other side, don't get distracted. Calm down and try to understand your surroundings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FE2)
【Rintaro】It'll be okay. I'm with you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FF2)
I gently caress her cheek, and Lukako gives a small sigh of relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200C)
【Luka】...Then, let's go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000201C)
I nod, and, hiding the shakiness in my fingertips from Lukako, set the microwave timer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000202C)
【Luka】I'll be sure to return...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000203C)
【Rintaro】Yeah. I'll be waiting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000204C)
I smile to Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000223A)
Right after, the entire room gets wrapped up in the electrical discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000224A)
When I see Lukako's body as if it's shining, I open my eyes wide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000226C)
The building violently shakes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000227C)
The smell of ozone fills my nose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000228C)
The already strong electrical discharge becomes even stronger, strong enough that I can't even open my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022A6)
【Luka】Okabe-sa--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B6)
Lukako's voice calling my name is suddenly cut short--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002728)
My entire body goes through shock and chills, just like it always does right after time leaping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002738)
【Rintaro】...This is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002748)
It's not like I time leaped myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002758)
Nevertheless, I teleported from the lab to Yanabayashi shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002768)
Did the world line change...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002778)
No, Reading Steiner didn't activate, so there's no way the world line changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002788)
Then, why--?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002798)
Was it because Lukako made small changes after jumping to the past...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027EC)
I look to the side, and Lukako is there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027FC)
When she notices my gaze, she gets up and smiles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000280C)
【Luka】Want to see the pictures?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000281C)
【Rintaro】Pictures?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000282C)
What's this about pictures?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000283C)
【Luka】It worked. I did it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000284C)
【Luka】Do you not remember? Okabe-san, you suddenly changed...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000285C)
【Rintaro】Right after you leaped into the past, I found myself standing here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000286C)
【Rintaro】Did you go to ComiMa?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002886)
Once again, Lukako starts crying wordlessly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002896)
Then, she nods slowly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028A6)
She takes out a few pictures and hand them out to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C0)
【Luka】Mayuri-chan... was so... happy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028DC)
I look at the first picture handed to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028EC)
I gasp in surprise when I see what's in it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FC)
【Rintaro】You and I, we got carried away...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290C)
Before I noticed, tears blur my vision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002960)
In that picture--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002970)
Was Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002980)
Lukako, Mayuri, and I were smiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C2)
