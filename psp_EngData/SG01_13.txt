【Kurisu?】Hmmm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFE)
I hear a woman's voice from the lounge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0E)
【Kurisu?】That's an interesting experiment you're doing there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1E)
【Rintaro】W, who's that!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2E)
I just felt my heart skip a beat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3E)
Overwhelmed by surprise, I quickly face the direction of the voice...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEC)
...And, I get pierced by a sharp glance aimed right at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFC)
【Rintaro】I, Impossible...! Why are you here...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0C)
【Rintaro】The genius who had her article published in "SCIENCE"... The woman who tortures men in front of an audience... And the one who holds the name of "The Zombie"...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1C)
【Rintaro】Makise Kurisu...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C64)
【Itaru】Nice explanation, bro...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7E)
【Kurisu】Who are you calling a zombie!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8E)
【Rintaro】What's the meaning of this!? With what purpose did you come here...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAC)
【Kurisu】I came here to meet you, Okabe Rintaro.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC6)
No, Hououin Kyouma-san, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDA)
What!? Why does she know my real name?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEA)
I'm sure that I never told her...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFA)
【Rintaro】I get it... So you're an agent of the organization, and a superhuman, as well...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0A)
【Rintaro】You are one of the undying...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D24)
【Kurisu】I never died. Please don't kill me off, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D34)
【Kurisu】Hashida-san, can you do something about this person?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4E)
【Itaru】He's only panicking since Miss Makise appeared at such a time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5E)
Daru doesn't seem to be perplexed by the appearance of this woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6E)
Why, exactly?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7E)
【Rintaro】Daru, did you betray me!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D98)
【Itaru】Okarin, stop the rampage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA8)
【Rintaro】Did she get a hold of your weakness? Or were you deceived by her charms?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC4)
I glare at Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD4)
Damn you for doing this to my right hand man...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE4)
【Rintaro】I won't forgive you, you biiiiitch!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFE)
【Kurisu】Calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0E)
I think I just saw Makise Kurisu's eyes light up a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1E)
Intensity which you wouldn't expect of an 18 year old.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2E)
Could it be that she didn't die and came back to life, but that she is a man-made machine soldier that replaced the dead Makise Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3E)
Well, I guess I should calm down for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF4)
【Kurisu】I found out about this place from Hashida-san after the lecture ended. Your name, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
What a boring truth... I am disappointed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
【Rintaro】So, you said that you came here to talk to me, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E0)
【Kurisu】Yes. I wanted to find out if what you said about me dying was the truth or an excuse for sexual harassment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001184)
Now that she mentions it, she treated me as a pervert yesterday...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001228)
Looking back at it, I really did do something terrible, and it's kind of amazing that she didn't call the cops on me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CC)
But it can't be helped. I think that everyone would react in a similar way to seeing a dead person appear right in front of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137A)
【Kurisu】I can tell from your current behavior that it was nothing but sexual harassment. Which means that I was right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141E)
【Rintaro】I'd prefer it if you didn't go to conclusions so quickly. You're misunderstanding me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
If this keeps up, I will be marked as a pervert!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001566)
I must clear up the misunderstanding!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160A)
【Kurisu】Well, I will leave that aside for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AE)
【Rintaro】Eh, you will...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001752)
That's a relief. I thought she was gonna call the police.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F6)
But she also said "for now".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195E)
With focus and a straight back, Kurisu briskly walks towards the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A90)
Even though she's only 18, she's got quite a nice figure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B34)
The way she walks also looks good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD8)
There's not much around the chest area, though!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7C)
In this cramped space Daru and I falter and try to make some distance away from her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D20)
Kuh, damn you. The development room is off limits for unauthorized people!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E22)
【Kurisu】By the way, I don't think I properly introduced myself yet. I am Makise Kurisu. It's nice to meet you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC6)
After saying that, she extents her hand towards me with a sour look on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6A)
What is this gesture?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200E)
Is she going to shoot some supernatural waves at me!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020BC)
【Kurisu】You can't even do a handshake? Japanese men sure lack common sense...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002160)
A handshake?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002204)
This genius girl who I met only yesterday and who almost marked me a pervert is asking me for a handshake?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022A8)
【Rintaro】Westerner!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002356)
【Kurisu】I lived in America for 7 years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023FA)
【Rintaro】Westerner...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A8)
Thin, supple, lovely fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000254C)
Healthy, elegant and real fingernails with no unnecessary manicures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F0)
I fix my gaze on that beauty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002694)
While standing in a ready-to-run position, I slowly extend my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002738)
I lightly grab the tip of Kurisu's index finger with my own thumb and index finger, and instantly let go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027E6)
【Kurisu】You're shaking too much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288A)
【Rintaro】I can feel your killing intent. This is commonly referred to as martial arts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292E)
【Kurisu】No, it is not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D2)
【Rintaro】Then it's NINJA--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A80)
【Kurisu】I'm telling you it isn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B24)
Kuh, this woman is completely cool-headed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC8)
Though, her way of speaking becomes scary sometimes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C6C)
【Rintaro】If you grew up in America, you should be asking for a handshake while smiling and saying "HAHAHA! NICE TOO MEET YOU!".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D10)
【Rintaro】No, a hug would be more American.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DB4)
Is it not possible for man-made machine soldiers?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E62)
【Kurisu】Just how narrow-minded are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F06)
Kurisu says that while shrugging.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FB6)
She already turned her eyes away from me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000305A)
Now, her gaze is aimed at the banana bunch next to the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030FE)
Specifically, the banana which was part of a ridiculous phenomenon that happened just now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031A2)
The only one in the bunch which is gelified.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000327E)
【Kurisu】...This is truly interesting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003322)
Bringing her face close to it, Kurisu is taking a thorough observation of the banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033C6)
【Kurisu】Do you have tweezers?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000346A)
【Rintaro】No!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000350E)
【Kurisu】Right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035B2)
Kurisu pierces the gelatinous banana with her lovely index finger.p
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003656)
She buries her it deep inside the soft and flabby banana.p
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036FA)
【Rintaro】What are you doing!? That's valuable experimental data...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A8)
【Kurisu】It's mushy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384C)
Kurisu quickly pulls out the finger. Some of the gelatinous substance is left on the tip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F0)
Without any hesitation vacillation, she puts it into her mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003994)
【Kurisu】...No taste, huh? Eww.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A38)
She says that with a straight face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ADC)
【Rintaro】You have the appetite of a child, resurrected one. If you're so hungry, then I will give you a single banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B8A)
【Kurisu】No, thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C66)
【Itaru】Either way, those bananas belong to Mayushi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D0A)
【Rintaro】No need to restrain yourself. I am telling you that I'll give you one!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DB8)
【Kurisu】As if I'd eat a pervert's banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F66)
【Itaru】A pervert's banana...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004010)
Daru's body shakes as if he just got an electric shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B4)
W, what? What's with him?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004158)
【Itaru】Eating, a pervert's banana... Mushy... Finger... Eww, and a sour look...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041FC)
Looks like his intracranial pervert processor started working at the highest speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042B6)
【Itaru】Miss Makise, Miss Makise. Could you say that one more time? With a scowl, if possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004364)
【Kurisu】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004408)
【Itaru】Come on, say "As if I'd eat a pervert's banana", and it'd be good if you can add "Aah, but..." afterwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044B6)
【Kurisu】...Hm? ...Hmm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004564)
【Kurisu】...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004608)
Kurisu's face reddens as she seems to have finally realized the meaning of the words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046AC)
【Rintaro】Fwahaha, Daru, you may be hopeless garbage and a disgusting pervert, but I want to say that what you did just now is awesome!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004750)
This is my first win against her!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047F4)
I must continue even further and make a nice combo attack!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004898)
Let's show this conceited little girl how adults fight!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000493C)
【Rintaro】So, Makise Kurisu. What did you imagine just now? Please, don't hesitate in telling us, fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049EA)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A8E)
【Rintaro】Come on, say it, girl genius! Let us hear the thoughts of a prodigy such as yourself!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B3C)
【Kurisu】You, idiot...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004BEC)
Perking up her shoulders, Kurisu faces away from us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C90)
Looks like she does have human-like emotions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D34)
I guess that crosses out her being a man-made machine soldier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004DD8)
Right now, I feel very refreshed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E7C)
This is probably one of the best feelings I've felt these past few years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F20)
As expected of my right hand man Daru. He's done an excellent job.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004FFC)
【Kurisu】So, both of you are perverts...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050AA)
【Itaru】Well, I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000514E)
Don't blush, you idiot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051F2)
【Rintaro】I don't want to have you calling me that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052A0)
【Kurisu】Okay. I apologize for my upstart behavior.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005344)
Kurisu deeply sighs and faces us again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053E8)
Her facial expression is calm and collected again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005496)
【Kurisu】Even though the cause of that was your sexual harassment, I will ignore that for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000553A)
Will you stop saying 'for now'? It worries me that you might call the cops on me afterwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055DE)
【Kurisu】I want you to explain it to me in detail. About this banana, and about this--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056CE)
Kurisu throws a glance at the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005772)
【Kurisu】Microwave oven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005816)
【Rintaro】It's top secret. Though, if I were to tell an outsider like you just one thing, I will tell you that the name of this thing is "Microwave Ophone (Temp)".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000593A)
【Kurisu】(Temp)? What does that mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059DE)
【Rintaro】Exactly what it says. The name is still temporary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A8C)
【Kurisu】I don't care about the name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B30)
【Rintaro】But the name is the only thing I can tell you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005BDE)
【Itaru】But, Okarin. Miss Makise might be able to explain this weird function, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C82)
【Rintaro】Hm, that's...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D26)
Well, Kurisu IS a genius...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DCA)
A genius to the extent of being able to win against me in an argument.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E6E)
But, I really can't stomach her impudent attitude.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005F12)
This girl is too dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FB6)
...And scary, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000605A)
I thought of a good idea just now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006108)
【Kurisu】You have a stupid grin on your face... Are you thinking something perverted again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000061EC)
【Rintaro】You said your name was Christina, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000629A)
【Kurisu】Who are you calling Christina!? I never said that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000633E)
It sounds like something from a Hollywood movie, so I thought it fits the atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063E2)
【Rintaro】If you want to know the secrets behind this microwave oven, there are conditions which you must meet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006490)
【Kurisu】...What are they?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006534)
【Rintaro】Condition #1. You must become a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065E2)
【Kurisu】Ramen...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006686)
【Rintaro】"Lab mem", you fool! Laboratory member!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000672A)
【Kurisu】You want me to become member of your research facility? I am planning to return to America in August, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067CE)
【Rintaro】You will write me an oath in which you will promise to never expose our secrets. If you break that promise, I will report you to the "SCIENCE" magazine as a lewd pervert.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000687C)
【Kurisu】Kuh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006958)
【Itaru】You're a demon, Okarin. I'd buy 5 copies of that magazine if it came out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006A08)
【Rintaro】From the moment you become a lab mem, I will use your brain until you go back to your country.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006AAC)
【Kurisu】...That pride is annoying. Okay then, show me the contract.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006B50)
【Rintaro】There's no such thing! This is a circle, not a company.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006BF4)
【Kurisu】...If I only have to give you my knowledge, then OK. But, if there are any perverted conditions, then the answer is NO.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006C98)
【Rintaro】There aren't any, so calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006D46)
【Kurisu】Sexual harassment, then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DEA)
【Rintaro】I'm telling you, I'm not gonna do that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E8E)
【Kurisu】Recently, you said "Condition #1", right? Then, there must be other conditions, as well. It's fully possible that it's something perverted--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006F32)
【Rintaro】Condition #2 is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006FD6)
【Rintaro】That you will ignore all of the sexual harassment that I did up until now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007084)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007160)
【Itaru】Okarin, you're so small! A very small person! That's something mesmerizing and admirable!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007204)
【Rintaro】I don't want you to tell me that. By the way, Daru's sexual harassment is not included in condition #2. You talk that out amongst yourselves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000072B2)
【Itaru】What? Are you fucking kidding me!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007362)
【Rintaro】Those are the only 2 conditions! If you don't accept them, then I politely ask you to leave!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007406)
【Rintaro】...Kukuku, well, what's your answer? I think that the conditions are pretty good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000074B4)
【Kurisu】For you, that is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007558)
Putting a finger against her temple, she exaggeratedly swings her head sideways.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007604)
【Kurisu】Jeez... It feels like you're making my brain produce excess <DICT>noradrenaline</DICT>. What a jaw-dropping feeling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000076A8)
【Rintaro】I don't care if you get some jaw-joint illness! Just answer whether you do or don't accept the conditions, Christina!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007756)
【Kurisu】Stop adding "tina"! I am Kurisu!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000077FA)
As if to make herself calm down, she looks up at the ceiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000789E)
Does Kurisu react like that because she grew up in America?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007954)
It looks like she's about to say "DAMN!" or "OH MY GOD!" or "MOTHERFUCK!".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000797A)
【Kurisu】...Okay. I accept.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000798A)
【Rintaro】Kukuku, a good answer. This very moment, you became Lab Mem No. 004.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000799A)
【Rintaro】Let's welcome Christina. No, Resurrected One The Zombie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000079B4)
【Kurisu】Both are wrong. Call me properly, Hououin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000079C4)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000079D4)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000079E4)
We have a 1 minute-long staring contest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000079F4)
The first one who looked away was Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007A04)
She puts on an air of disappointment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007A1E)
【Kurisu】What a kid...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007A2E)
【Rintaro】Did you say something, perverted genius girl?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007A48)
【Kurisu】Ahh! Also, "pervert" is forbidden! I will also stop treating you as one! So let it go already!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007A58)
【Rintaro】If you understand, then it's alright. Let's go back to the real issue at hand. Daru, explain Christina--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007A72)
【Kurisu】"tina" is also forbidden.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007ABA)
【Rintaro】Explain Kurisu-kun all about the experiments we've conducted up until now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007AD4)
【Itaru】But, I refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007AE4)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007B5C)
In the end, I had to be the one to explain it all. When I tried to do my usual displays, she told me to "stop derailing".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007B6C)
I spoke about the Microwave Ophone's (Temp) and the banana's relationship without a shred of falsehood. As expected of a genius, she didn't ask a single question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C1E)
【Kurisu】--This is truly interesting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C2E)
【Rintaro】Let's hear your opinion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C48)
【Kurisu】At the very least, I am quite sure we can dump worthless theories like electromagnetic wave weaponry or teleportation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C58)
This Madame sure is belligerent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C72)
【Kurisu】Can we do the experiment again? I want to see this happen with my own eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C8E)
After saying that, she picks a normal banana from the bunch without even waiting for our approval.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007C9E)
With a serious look on her face, she puts the banana in the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and uses her own phone to start it up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CAE)
I wonder why.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CBE)
While gazing at her, I think that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CCE)
She looks like she's having fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CDE)
Even though she always has a sour look on her face, I thought that for some unknown reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007CEE)
Well, since she's a splendid scholar in the making, it's not weird if she's also an experiment-loving girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007D64)
【Kurisu】Okabe-san and Hashida-san, please look at the banana bunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007D74)
【Rintaro】I'd like it if you didn't give me orders. I am the mad scientist Houou--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007D8E)
【Kurisu】Whatever, just don't look away from them!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007D9E)
Instant anger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007DF2)
Just like we were told, we stare at the bananas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E02)
We'd be looking at them even if she didn't order us, since we neglected to do so the first time the "teleportation" happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E1C)
【Kurisu】60 seconds have passed. Any change?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E36)
【Itaru】Nope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E46)
Right now, the banana should become gelified and return to the bunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E56)
If a phenomenon happens once, we can call it an accident or an unexpected byproduct, but if it happens twice, then we can say that something is "actually happening".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E66)
If it happens now, Kurisu will probably rethink some things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E76)
Then, she might agree that this is the first successful teleportation experiment in human history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E86)
As if praying, I keep staring at the banana--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007E96)
【Kurisu】100 seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007EA6)
A few seconds after Kurisu said that--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000804C)
【Itaru】Ah!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000805C)
Out of nowhere, a gelbana "appeared" without any sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000806C)
There are now 2 of them in the bunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000807C)
It happened in an instant shorter than the blink of an eye.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000808C)
【Itaru】It appeared!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000809C)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000080AC)
The impact is enough to make me lose my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000080BC)
Just now, I saw something unbelievable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000080CC)
An obvious teleportation phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000080E8)
The timer of the oven rings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008104)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008114)
With a hard expression, Kurisu is looking inside the microwave oven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008124)
【Rintaro】What happened on your side?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000813E)
【Kurisu】Eh? Uh, ehmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000814E)
【Kurisu】A, after 104 seconds, have passed, it, it disappeared. Instantly, yes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000815E)
She's slightly panicking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000816E)
There are only a few people that wouldn't be surprised by such a phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000817E)
【Rintaro】This is an actual teleport. The first one in human history!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008198)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081A8)
Kurisu quickly becomes calm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081B8)
She starts thinking after wrinkling up her eyebrows and folding her arms...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081C8)
Raising the tiptoe of her right foot up and down...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081D8)
Mumbling something in a whisper...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081E8)
【Kurisu】Instant movement... Is that, really possible...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000081F8)
【Kurisu】But it actually happened... No matter how unbelievable that is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000821A)
【Kurisu】Is it <DICT>quantum teleportation</DICT>...? No no, that's about the quantum level...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000822A)
【Rintaro】Don't avert your eyes from the truth. What you just saw is the everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008244)
To these words of mine, Kurisu responds with a sharp look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008254)
Those eyes are like those of a sniper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008264)
Her fighting spirit is not to be underestimated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008274)
【Kurisu】...Is it really a teleport? It's dangerous to start with the conclusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008284)
【Rintaro】Well then, girl genius, what would you call this phenomenon?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000829E)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000082EE)
【Kurisu】Let's look it over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000082FE)
【Kurisu】The bunch of bananas and the frozen fried food didn't teleport, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000830E)
【Rintaro】...So, there might be limits to the size of the object which can teleport.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000831E)
【Kurisu】But fried chicken is smaller than bananas, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000832E)
【Rintaro】For all experiments we used the same 12-in-1 pack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000833E)
Mayuri doesn't buy anything besides "Juicy Kara-age Number One!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008386)
【Itaru】That's quite a large amount.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083AC)
【Kurisu】What about salt? You said you experimented with it, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083BC)
One time, we tried this experiment with a handful of table salt placed on a plate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083CC)
The result was that nothing happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083E6)
【Kurisu】The plate was in the way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000083F6)
【Rintaro】We tried without it, as well, but nothing changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008410)
【Kurisu】Then, does this mean that the grains of salt are too small for something to happen...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000842A)
【Kurisu】Hmm... I need a clue...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000843A)
Looks like our girl genius is fighting a hard battle. She's aimlessly wandering around the room while looking really irritated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000844A)
【Kurisu】Any others? Are there any other things you found out that are related to the Microwave Ophone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000845A)
【Rintaro】It's not Microwave Ophone, but Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008474)
【Kurisu】That doesn't matter at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008484)
【Kurisu】So? Is there anything you know about it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008494)
Kurisu askingly looks not at me, but at Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000084A4)
He's the one who did all the maintenance of the Microwave Ophone (Temp), so he should know more about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000084EC)
【Itaru】Ah, right--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000084FC)
Daru timidly opens his mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008516)
【Itaru】This one time, this thing did a great electrical discharge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008530)
【Rintaro】What!? That's the first time I heard of that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008540)
【Itaru】It happened when you weren't in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008550)
【Kurisu】How powerful was the discharge?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008560)
【Itaru】It was like a fluorescent lamp was lit up. It continued for like 2 seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008570)
【Kurisu】What was the situation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008580)
【Itaru】I was tuning the cellphone which is attached to it. I took it out and replaced it with my own.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008590)
【Itaru】And a short time after I did that... Sparky sparks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085A0)
【Rintaro】When did that happen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085BA)
【Itaru】Yesterday's noon. When Okarin went to see Dr. Nakabachi's presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085D4)
【Kurisu】Dr. Nakabachi...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085E4)
That's right, yesterday I went to see Dr. Nakabachi's presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000085F4)
Speaking of which, the time travel theory that he spoke was all a John Titor rip-off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000860C)
It could be that Nakabachi is one of the <DICT>inside people</DICT> of the John Titor that's posting on the boards right now
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000861C)
【Rintaro】But wait. Daru, you said that Dr. Nakabachi's presentation was cancelled--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000862C)
【Itaru】Yes. But Okarin, you still went there along with Mayushi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000863C)
...I don't have such memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000864C)
What I remember is that Nakabachi's presentation was never cancelled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000865C)
My memories are still inconsistent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000866C)
【Rintaro】Speaking of which, I sent Daru a mail. Did it reach you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000867C)
【Itaru】What mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008696)
【Kurisu】The one that you showed me yesterday in ATF?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000086A6)
After I nod, Kurisu comes closer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000086F6)
【Kurisu】If I remember correctly, it said that in that presentation I was stabbed by a man and died, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008706)
【Rintaro】Yeah. For some reason, it reached Daru's phone a week in the past...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000874E)
【Itaru】Huh? But that was a lie, wasn't it? If it wasn't, then the time stamp wouldn't be weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000875E)
【Rintaro】I always speak the truth! If you don't believe me, then I'll show you my transmission history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000877A)
I take out my phone and look through my sent messages.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000878A)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000879A)
【Rintaro】Not here...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087AA)
There are no traces of that mail in my history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087BA)
I clearly remember what happened about 30 minutes after Nakabachi's presentation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087CA)
After seeing the dead Kurisu, me and the ~10 other people with me started panicking and left the Radio Center in a rush. I sent the mail after that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087DA)
No matter how hard I search, I can't find the record of the mail I sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087EA)
...Something that should be here, is gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000087FA)
Just like the banana inside the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000880A)
【Rintaro】Why isn't it here...? I'm sure I sent it at about 1'o clock yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008852)
【Itaru】Ah, it was about that time that the electrical discharge happened! "It's Okay to Laugh!" was just about to end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008862)
That moment, it occurred to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008872)
Just like Edison wanted, I got the 1％ of inspiration. I am truly a genius!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008882)
With a broad grin, I look over Daru and Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008892)
【Rintaro】I get it... So that's how it was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000088DA)
【Kurisu】Eh, what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000088F4)
【Itaru】Ah, this is one of Okarin's weird habits, so I think it's better to ignore it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008904)
【Rintaro】Silence! I finally got it! I finally understand it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008966)
I repeatedly hit the top of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) with the palm of my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008976)
【Rintaro】The mail that I've sent and the weird electrical discharge phenomenon--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008986)
【Rintaro】Are somehow related!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008A16)
【Itaru】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008A26)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008A36)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008A50)
【Kurisu】...So?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008A60)
【Rintaro】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008A70)
【Kurisu】I understand that they're somehow related, but how?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008A80)
【Rintaro】It's your job to find that out, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008A9A)
【Kurisu】Hashida-san, it's very tiring to talk to this person.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008AAA)
【Itaru】Everyone is like that at first. The basic counter-measure against him is to not take him seriously--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008ABA)
【Rintaro】Hey! Don't negate all of my speech and conduct.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008ACA)
Okay then, I shall prove that I am right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008ADA)
If we repeat the electrical discharge, then the time-stamp of a mail should become weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008B2A)
【Rintaro】Daru, explain in detail the state of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) when the electrical discharge occurred.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008B44)
【Itaru】It was in quite a ridiculous state. My cellphone was connected to it, and I was testing if it was possible to control it with the X68000 X68k.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008B70)
I take out the phone that is being used by the Phone Microwave (Temp), and replace it with my own.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008B80)
After doing so, I hear the sound of a door opening.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008B90)
【Mayuri】I'm baack. Fwoo, I'm hungry~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008C3E)
The one who enters is Mayuri, carrying a convenience store bag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008C4E)
Looks like she's done with her part-time job.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008C68)
【Mayuri】Fried foo~d. Juicy Karaage Number One♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008C82)
【Mayuri】Okarin, did you buy the bananas? Hey, Okari~n?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008D8A)
Looking inside the development room, she tilts her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008DA4)
【Mayuri】Huhuh? A guest?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008DB4)
After noticing Kurisu, Mayuri slightly bows her head while smiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008DCE)
【Mayuri】I'm Mayushii. It's nice to meet you~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008DDE)
【Kurisu】I'm Makise. I just became a Lab Mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008DEE)
【Mayuri】Eh? Really? That's great! A girl Lab Mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008E0A)
【Rintaro】Daru, what kind of control were you attempting with the X68000 X68k?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008E52)
【Itaru】Just like I said before, I was doing email receiving setting adjustments. Specifically, I was monitoring the moment that the microwave receives a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008E62)
【Itaru】That's why I turned it on in "freezing mode" for 120 secs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008E72)
【Itaru】Today, we tried to enable the PC to do the freezing function, right? I did the same tests yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008E82)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, put the Juicy Karaage Number One into the Microwave Ophone (Temp)!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008ECA)
【Mayuri】You want to eat it? I can give one for each of you~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008EDA)
With her usual nonchalance, Mayuri puts the fried chicken into the microwave oven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008F48)
I have Daru explain everything that's shown PC monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008F60)
The operation method is not very different from <DICT>DOS</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008F70)
I enter "120#"" on the keyboard and press the enter key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008F8C)
The Microwave Ophone starts working.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008F9C)
The turntable and the Juicy Karaage Number One placed on it start rotating in the opposite direction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008FE4)
Kurisu is observing the activity of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) with a serious look on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00008FF4)
As if not to miss any abnormality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000090C0)
【Rintaro】So, those are all the required conditions for the electrical discharge to occur, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000090DA)
【Itaru】Ehmm, how was it, again...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000090EA)
【Rintaro】You there, my assistant!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009132)
【Kurisu】Huh? Me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009142)
【Rintaro】Who else could I be talking about!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000915C)
【Kurisu】When did I become your assistant!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000916C)
【Rintaro】Whatever, just send a mail to my phone already!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000917C)
If the conditions are right, then sending an email to my phone connected to the Microwave Ophone (Temp) will cause the time-stamp of that mail to be the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000918C)
My assistant shrugs with a sullen face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000919C)
【Kurisu】I don't know your email address.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000091AC)
【Rintaro】Useless assistant...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000091C6)
【Kurisu】Don't arbitrarily make me your own assistant!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000091D6)
【Rintaro】Daru, use your phone to send me an email.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000091F4)
【Itaru】Ah, ok, what should I type?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009204)
【Rintaro】Anything!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000921E)
【Itaru】Ehmm, ehmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000922E)
【Rintaro】Just send "Christina is a pervert".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009248)
【Kurisu】I told you that "pervert" is forbidden!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009262)
【Itaru】Well, then I'll go with "Okarin is a pervert".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009272)
【Rintaro】You damn traitor...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000928C)
【Kurisu】Hashida-san, good job!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000929C)
Grinning broadly, Kurisu throws a thumbs up to Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000092AC)
That is really hard to stomach.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000092FC)
【Mayuri】Aah, Mayushii's bananas...

As we're doing this and that, Mayuri looks at the usual banana bunch with a face that's about to cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000931C)
【Mayuri】...Are now gelbanas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009364)
【Kurisu】We used them for experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009374)
【Mayuri】But they were Mayushii's...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000093BC)
【Itaru】Should I send the mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000093D6)
【Kurisu】Mayushii-san, we'll give you money afterwards. Specifically, Hououin-san will...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000093E6)
【Rintaro】Why me!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009404)
【Mayuri】C'mon now. Why are you always experimenting on Mayushii's food?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000941E)
【Mayuri】Ah, wait, are you experimenting on the Karaage, too?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009438)
【Rintaro】That's right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009452)
【Itaru】Ok ok, sending now. Sending sending...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000946E)
Mayuri quickly walks towards the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000947E)
With no hesitation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000094CE)
Mayuri puts her hand on the door--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000094E4)
【Rintaro】Hey, wait, don't open it, Mayuri!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000094FE)
【Mayuri】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000950E)
While tilting her head, she opens it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009706)
【Mayuri】Wha-wha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009716)
In the dimly lit development room, a blueish-white light akin to lightning appears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009798)
【Kurisu】An electrical discharge!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000097EC)
The violent sound of sparks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009834)
I grab Mayuri's body and move her a step away from the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009852)
【Itaru】Is, isn't this bad!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009AFC)
A faint smoke starts spreading out across the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B0C)
I smell something burning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B1C)
From the flashes of light, my eyes are a bit paralyzed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B2C)
I repeatedly blink in an attempt to restore my eyesight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B3C)
I hear Kurisu and Daru coughing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B4C)
【Rintaro】Are you all okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B5C)
【Itaru】S, somewhat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B6C)
【Kurisu】Hey, are you sure that the discharge was only about 2 seconds?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B7C)
Mayuri strongly grabs my upper arm with her thin fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009B8C)
【Mayuri】O, Okarin? Ehmm, what just happened?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009C80)
My vision gradually returns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009C90)
Mayuri looks very perplexed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CA0)
【Rintaro】Are you okay? No burns or anything?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CB0)
【Mayuri】Nah... It doesn't hurt anywhere, so I think I'm okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CC0)
Looks like I was right to protect Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CD0)
As an insane mad scientist, I must protect my comrades from danger, even if I have to use my own body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CE0)
I let go of Mayuri's body, which I have been holding tight until now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009CF0)
Ahh... This was quite an event.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009D00)
I wipe the sweat off my forehead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009D1A)
【Kurisu】W, wait, look at this!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009D2A)
Kurisu's voice is tense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009DB8)
After my vision returned, I go back into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009DC8)
The sight in front of me makes me lose my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009DE4)
The large table in the middle of this room. Made of wood and sturdy enough to hold 5 or 6 people. The table which supported the Microwave Ophone and the X68000...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009DF4)
...Is split right into two.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009E04)
Everything that was on the table is now on the floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009E14)
And--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009E24)
The vital part - the microwave--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009E92)
Is piercing through the broken table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009EA2)
It has literally penetrated the floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009EB2)
【Itaru】What the hell? How...? Even if it is a microwave, it's not heavy enough to open up a hole in the floor...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009EC2)
【Kurisu】An electrical discharge cannot do this. What other phenomena...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009ED2)
I was lost for words until now, but the seriousness of the situation made me open my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009F40)
【Rintaro】Ku, kukuku, fuahahaha! E, everything is just as planned!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009F50)
For now, a loud laugh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009F60)
Then, I attempt to take out the cellphone and do the usual, but unfortunately, it's in the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00009FFE)
El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A00E)
Without actually saying anything, I lip those words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A01E)
They have no meaning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A02E)
I only use them because I like their "feeling".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A03E)
However, since they lack a meaning, they can eventually get one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A04E)
Due to the many years of saying them, I can now calm my heart and mind just by mumbling them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A0E6)
【Itaru】...So, about that Mayushi's fried chicken.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A12E)
【Mayuri】Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A19C)
After standing up, Mayuri slowly looks at the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A1AC)
The microwave is on the floor, and the door is completely open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A1BC)
【Mayuri】Aah, Mayushii's fried chicken is all black...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A1CC)
Since she looks downhearted, I gently hit her shoulders to cheer her up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A1DC)
【Rintaro】Juicy Karaage Number One became a noble sacrifice for the sake of the success of a grand experiment. Let us pray for it's happiness in the next world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A2B2)
【Kurisu】Who cares about the fried food? Right now, we must analyze what happened with the Microwave Opho--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A2FA)
【Mayuri】But I care about it, Christina-chan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A314)
【Kurisu】Hey! Hououin Kyouma, do something about this! Mayushii-san wrongly remembers my name!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A35C)
【Itaru】I think we should ventilate the place first. Achoo
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A36C)
【Rintaro】Shut up, all of you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A37C)
I throw an overpowering gaze at everyone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A398)
This very moment will be recorded as the moment when the experiment of the century has succeeded, and mankind has advanced a huge step.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A3A8)
This is a day which will create history. These buffoons do not have the right to ruin that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A3B8)
With my heart beating fast, I extend my hand towards my cellphone which is still connected to the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A412)
Happily, despite all that electrical discharge, my cellphone is unharmed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A422)
I quickly operate it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A49E)
I bring up the list of received emails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A4AE)
Newest mails that I receive should be at the top.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A4BE)
But...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A4CE)
The throbbing of my heart speeds up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A4DE)
The mail that Daru sent just before the electrical discharge isn't the topmost.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A4EE)
This "miraculous" phenomenon is exactly what I desired.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A4FE)
I look through the older entries.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A50E)
And I--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A51E)
Have--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A52E)
見つけた。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A5EC)
【Rintaro】Found it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A5FC)
Success. I don't know why, but the experiment was successful!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A60C)
The time-stamp is saying that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A61C)
The receive date of this email is the 24th of July, which is 5 days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A62C)
This is the same as with the "Kurisu stabbing notification mail".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A63C)
A mail sent in the 29th has went backwards in time and reached the 24th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A64C)
Everything occurred to me just now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A65C)
【Rintaro】Everything has connected. The meaning behind all of these events, and a single answer to them all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A66C)
【Rintaro】I just saw the truth behind the hidden function of this Microwave Ophone...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A682)
【Rintaro】This isn't just my intuition, but my conviction!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A6CA)
【Kurisu】...Say it. What do you think it is?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A6DA)
I'm becoming aware of my own grin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A6EA)
Kurisu is glaring at me, and I take it without flinching.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A6FA)
【Rintaro】First of all, let's say this. All the greatest inventions are accidental byproducts of that which goes on in the lab. That is called serendipity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A70A)
【Kurisu】Leave the boasting aside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A71A)
Guh... Why is she rejecting my introductory remarks?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A72A)
Oh well, let's get to the point, then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A73A)
【Rintaro】The email went back to the "past".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A74A)
【Rintaro】The defrosted fried food "returned" to a frozen state.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A75A)
【Rintaro】The banana that was cut off from the bunch "returned" to it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A774)
【Kurisu】...It can't be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A784)
Kurisu seems to get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A794)
As expected of my genius assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A7A4)
【Rintaro】Oh yes it can...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A7B4)
This is the choice of Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A7C4)
【Rintaro】This Microwave Ophone (Temp) is a--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000A7DA)
【Rintaro】Time machine...!
