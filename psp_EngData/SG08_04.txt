<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001FC)
My mental simulation results in disastrous defeat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
In all the ways I try to tell Lukako the truth, the probability that she cries is 120％.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000021C)
That result should be obvious in a sense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000308)
Since I already have proof of the result.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000318)
The proof being the time I mistook Lukako for a guy and she ended up in tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000328)
Well, actually, that kid cries at trivial things anyway...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000338)
Me talking to Lukako now is like touching a sore.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A8)
Tch, can't do anything but consult with Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B8)
Since my Assistant is a girl, she should understand a woman's heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EA)
And with that said, I call Kurisu out to the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, and start a one-on-one consultation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FA)
【Kurisu】You seem pretty serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000050A)
【Rintaro】Actually, I'm facing a difficult problem. A very delicate problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000524)
【Kurisu】Delicate? That word's like an antiparallel vector to you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000534)
【Rintaro】And that's exactly why I want to consult you, Assistant. It needs to be a woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000556)
【Kurisu】<DICT>Oh, you</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000570)
【Kurisu】What do you even mean by "it needs to be a woman"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000580)
I explain all the circumstances to her-- including how many times I've time leaped, and what happened with Suzuha and Faris, of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000590)
How many times have I explained this to her now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C2)
This time, Kurisu believes unexpectedly easily that I've time leaped several times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D2)
The only thing she didn't believe was the story about Lukako. She just started groaning "huuuummmm."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E2)
【Kurisu】Urushibara-san is actually a guy, huh. That's completely beyond imagination.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F2)
【Rintaro】But it's the truth. Was, the truth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060C)
【Kurisu】So basically, umm, wait...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000626)
She wrinkles her brow in thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000636)
【Kurisu】You mean she actually looks like Hashida?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000646)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000656)
Ah crap, I got a mental image there for a sec.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000666)
Kurisu seems the same way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000688)
【Rintaro&Kurisu (R)】That's terrible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000698)
【Rintaro&Kurisu (K)】That's terrible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006AC)
We frown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C6)
【Kurisu】Absolutely impossible. I won't accept that such a cute kid was a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D6)
【Rintaro】Just wait. Hold your horses. I never said that Lukako looked like a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E6)
【Rintaro】Rather, he looked like she does now. She's been androgynous ever since he was a guy, so much you couldn't help but think he was secreting excess female hormones.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F6)
Because of that, I didn't notice when Lukako first became a girl, and made a fatal mistake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000710)
【Kurisu】He looked like she does now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000720)
Kurisu's glance wanders for a moment--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000073A)
【Kurisu】That's permissible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074A)
She muttered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075A)
I don't know who's permitting it, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077E)
【Kurisu】So, you want to turn her back into a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000078E)
【Rintaro】Unless we do that, Mayuri can't be saved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000079E)
【Kurisu】Mayuri's life, and Urushibara-san's gender, huh... That's so crazy it doesn't seem real at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C4)
【Kurisu】Have you come up with a solution?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D4)
【Rintaro】Of course. I'll have Lukako turn back into a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E4)
【Kurisu】That might be cruel treatment, in a sense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F4)
【Rintaro】I'm consulting you like this to find out how to do this while hurting her the least.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000804)
I gulp a mouthful of Dr Pepper and grind my teeth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000814)
【Rintaro】...It feels like I've been cursed for my own carelessness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
【Rintaro】D-mails shouldn't have been used by so many people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
This is punishment. Punishment for my careless actions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
Using D-mails, I'm shouldering all the pain of Suzuha, Faris, and now, Lukako. I must shoulder it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085E)
【Kurisu】Nothing will happen no matter how much you regret what you did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086E)
【Kurisu】I have one solution to your consultation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087E)
Christina sighs, blowing her bangs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000898)
【Kurisu】Don't say anything to Urushibara-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A8)
【Rintaro】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B8)
【Kurisu】This is just my assumption, but you have an advantage over Urushibara-san. Basically, the advantage of "knowing the contents of the D-mail".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008CC)
【Kurisu】So, you don't have to tell her--
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E6)
 wait, him? Ex-him?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000904)
【Kurisu】...you don't have to tell Urushibara-san. You can just send the "cancellation D-mail".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000914)
【Rintaro】You mean, pretend to be Lukako and send the mail to Lukako's mother 18 years ago, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092E)
【Kurisu】Anyway, if the world line changes, then that truth will all be "undone".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093E)
【Kurisu】In this case, you can just ignore things like ethics and delicacy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000094E)
As expected of a scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000095E)
So, results-oriented thinking, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000096E)
【Rintaro】Just one problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000097E)
【Rintaro】I don't know Lukako's mom's pager number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000998)
【Kurisu】Haah!? Are you an idiot!? Why didn't you write a memo!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A8)
【Rintaro】I didn't think it would come to this back then!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B8)
Kurisu clicks her tongue a little. She rubs her brow with her fingers while muttering and thinking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D2)
【Kurisu】...What if you just ask for her mother's pager number directly? Think of a good excuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E2)
【Rintaro】That'd make me look suspicious...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F2)
【Kurisu】What are you so scared about? That's not the usual vain and arrogant Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A02)
Vain and arrogant? That was uncalled for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A12)
I don't have time to be Hououin Kyouma now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A22)
【Kurisu】Just do that random speech you usually do. I mean, she's naive after all--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3C)
【Kurisu】Wow, I hate myself for saying that. I'm a bad girl...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4C)
Kurisu's putting herself down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5C)
【Rintaro】But maybe I should ask bluntly. It might be better to just tell the truth in good faith than to play around with poor tricks... maybe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6C)
【Kurisu】It's funny for a mad scientist to be in good faith, isn't it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8A)
【Kurisu】"I'll brainwash you, fuhahaha!"
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA4)
 fits you better.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
I was being serious...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC8)
【Rintaro】I will shoulder Lukako's "pain". That's something I must do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD8)
【Rintaro】When I finally cancel that D-mail, the fact that Lukako was a girl will be "undone".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE8)
【Rintaro】That's why I must shoulder it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B02)
【Kurisu】Then you didn't need to consult me. Go to her right away and tell her what you explained to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B12)
【Rintaro】That's true, I guess...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B22)
True. That's the only choice I can take...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C52)
There are few worshipers at the shrine, like always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C62)
I guess that's exactly how it can keep its dignified silence even though it's less than a 10 minute walk from Akihabara Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAA)
【Luka】Ah, Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBA)
Lukako is sweeping the grounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD4)
【Luka】I-I'm sorry, I left "Samidare" in my room...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE4)
【Rintaro】No, that's okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFE)
【Luka】Eh, it, really is?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0E)
Well I'm stumped now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1E)
I don't have the determination to tell her the truth now that we're face to face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D38)
【Luka】...did something... happen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D48)
【Rintaro】W-well...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D58)
Lukako's crying face from before crosses my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D68)
It was very sad. If possible, I don't want to make her cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D78)
No, why am acting so weak!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D88)
I can't stop here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D98)
I swore to do anything if it's to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA8)
And Lukako probably only said he wanted to become a girl out of curiosity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB8)
If I explain everything properly, she shouldn't refuse to become a guy again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC8)
【Rintaro】Lukako!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE2)
【Luka】Uh, yes!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF2)
When I grab both her shoulders, calling out to her so close we're almost pressed together, Lukako's cheeks start to flush.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E02)
【Rintaro】Please calm down and listen. The truth is, you, were really...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E18)
【Rintaro】A guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E28)
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E38)
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E48)
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E58)
No reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E7E)
Or, so I thought. Blobs of tears start welling up in Lukako's eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8E)
【Luka】You're... saying that again...? Sniff...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9E)
Aaahh, I made her cry again...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EAE)
But this time, I'm not flustered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBE)
【Rintaro】Listen! Unless you turn back into a guy... Mayuri's life, is no more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECE)
【Luka】Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDE)
I explained everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEE)
About time machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFE)
About the D-mail Lukako sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0E)
About Mayuri's sudden fate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1E)
About how to avoid it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2E)
I talked on and on about everything in a one-sided conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F48)
【Luka】...you, you're joking, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F58)
That was Lukako's first response after hearing everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F68)
【Luka】I can't... believe any of it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F78)
Her voice is trembling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F92)
【Luka】You're in character as, uhh, Kyouma-san, right...? You are, aren't you...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA2)
Shaking her head no, she backs away from me, step by step.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB2)
【Luka】But that setting, it's too cruel. Um, it troubles me, and I think it would make Mayuri-chan sad too...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC2)
【Rintaro】I know you're confused hearing this all of a sudden. But, it's all true. I witnessed her death, countless times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD2)
【Rintaro】I'm sorry for making this selfish request of you. But I beg you... To save Mayuri... I want you to become a guy again...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
【Luka】Oooh... Please, tell me... you're joking... Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFC)
【Luka】A, guy... I can't possibly... be.. a guy... ooh... I don't want to...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100C)
【Luka】I've always been a girl, since I was born... that's cruel...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001026)
【Luka】And why... of all people... does it have to be Okabe-san... to say so...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001036)
【Luka】It's embarrassing... sniff... this... is too much...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001046)
Lukako covers her face with both hands to snuff out her weeping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001056)
【Rintaro】Like hell it's embarrassing. It feels more out of place to me that you're a girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001066)
Lukako's entire body twitches--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001076)
And her crying stops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001086)
Mmm!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001096)
【Luka】...be-san... tha... way...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A6)
I could barely pick up her voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B6)
【Rintaro】What? What did you say?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C6)
She lowers the hands that had covered her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D6)
Lukako was making a really sad... smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F0)
【Luka】Okabe-san... thinks of me... in that way, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000116E)
Then Lukako shakes off my hands, running away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117E)
【Rintaro】Lukako! Wait!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118E)
She doesn't stop even when I call.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000119E)
She disappears into the shrine office.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AE)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BE)
It turned out just like my simulation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CE)
I sigh, leaving the shrine, dejected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DE)
I need to think of plan...
<FILEEND09>
