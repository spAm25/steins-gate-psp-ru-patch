#WRITE(PTR, $00000204)
When I returned to the lab about 2 hours later, Kurisu has already left.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000214)
And in her place was a single mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000224)
While sitting down on the sofa, drying my hair with a towel, I look towards the PC in the corner of the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000234)
The IBN 5100 was already there connected to it, ready for whenever Daru was ready to start hacking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000244)
I already contacted Daru by mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000254)
Hacking starts tomorrow at noon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000264)
When I said so to Daru, I drove myself into a corner, so that I couldn't turn back no matter how much I hesitated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000274)
I chose Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000284)
I will let Kurisu die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000294)
Showering didn't calm down the tightening of my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A4)
Honestly speaking, I couldn't deny the feeling I was washing away Kurisu's words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B4)
The fact that she's okay with this leaves a bad aftertaste.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C4)
Is she really... okay with this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000346)
【Mayuri】...is someone here-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041A)
Mayuri opens the lab door and peeks her face in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000434)
When she sees me, she looks like she's about to burst into tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000444)
But soon, she smiles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000526)
【Mayuri】It's Okarin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000536)
【Rintaro】What's up?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000546)
【Mayuri】Oh, nothing. I just decided to come here. Ehhehe-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000556)
I swallow my breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000566)
Maybe I should explain the situation to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000576)
But if I tell her, Mayuri will be sure to feel indebted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000586)
Mayuri doesn't really need to know in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000596)
Things will be okay as long as we hack SERN and I reach the β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000662)
【Mayuri】You know, lately, I've gotten fewer chances to speak with you, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000672)
【Mayuri】But I don't want to be a burden to Okarin either-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FC)
Shouldn't it be okay even if I end this without saying anything?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070C)
Shouldn't it be okay even if I don't tell Mayuri I'm sacrificing Kurisu for her sake?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000754)
【Mayuri】Did you take a shower-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000764)
Mayuri wraps around behind the sofa, grabs the bathtowel on my head, and starts wiping my hair dry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077E)
【Mayuri】Okarin, you smell good like shampoo-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000078E)
Saying so, she buried her nose into my hair and started sniffing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000079E)
【Rintaro】Hey, stop that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007AE)
I tilt my head to escape.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007BE)
Mayuri goes back work wiping my hair dry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D8)
【Mayuri】Today... I didn't go to ComiMa...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E8)
【Rintaro】Hm? Why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F8)
【Mayuri】I was thinking about Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000808)
【Mayuri】Whenever I remember Okarin's painful looking face, I can't enjoy ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000818)
【Mayuri】So, I went all the way to Ariake, but came back without participating-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000828)
【Rintaro】I see... Sorry. For worrying you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000838)
【Mayuri】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000848)
I wonder if I should speak.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000858)
Or rather, if I shouldn't let Mayuri know anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000920)
【Mayuri】You know, lately, I've gotten fewer chances to speak with you, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000930)
【Mayuri】So, Mayushii might be getting a little lonely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098A)
【Rintaro】Mayuri. If I said I was keeping a secret from you, what would you think?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A4)
【Mayuri】...You mean something surprising, like "Actually, Okarin and Chris-chan are going out"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B4)
【Rintaro】Why would it be that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C4)
【Mayuri】But Okarin and Chris-chan are getting along really well, you know? I think you two are meant for each other-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D4)
【Rintaro】...I'm not talking about anything like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009EE)
【Mayuri】Ah, okay...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009FE)
【Mayuri】I don't want you to tell me everything if you don't want to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0E)
【Mayuri】Since I'm a hostage, it's natural for me to not have a choice or to not be told anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1E)
【Rintaro】I'm not talking about anything like that...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A38)
【Mayuri】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A54)
Mayuri's hand is separated from my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A64)
Wanting to know where it went, I look over my shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B38)
I took the hand of Mayuri standing there, using a little force.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B48)
【Mayuri】...Mayushii doesn't want to be a burden for Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B58)
Again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B68)
【Mayuri】So I'll wait until Okarin's ready to tell me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B82)
【Mayuri】I said the same thing yesterday, didn't I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B92)
【Rintaro】I might not tell you your entire life, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAC)
【Mayuri】It would really bug me, but I guess it couldn't be helped then...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBC)
【Rintaro】Even if what I'm hiding is related to you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCC)
【Mayuri】To Mayushii...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDC)
【Rintaro】I'm haven't told you because it could hurt you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEC)
【Mayuri】...Could that be why Okarin's been making that painful face?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFC)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C16)
【Mayuri】If that's the case, I want you to tell me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C26)
【Mayuri】I don't want to see Okarin in pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C36)
【Rintaro】Even if it means you might get hurt?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C46)
And then, Mayuri gave me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C60)
A gentle smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C70)
【Mayuri】Yep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C80)
She nods without hesitation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C90)
I was taken aback by that smile that showed no sign of malice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAA)
【Mayuri】I said so yesterday too. Mayushii doesn't want to be a burden for Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBA)
【Mayuri】When Mayushii was sad because of what happened to Grandma, Okarin took Mayushi hostage, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD4)
【Mayuri】So Mayushii always thought she could lend her strength to Okarin whenever he was sad, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE4)
【Mayuri】Mayushii might not be of any use, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF4)
Any use...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBC)
That moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCC)
I remembered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDC)
Mayuri's death tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEC)
The future I've been through once before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFC)
Mayuri's last words when she died protecting me--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0C)
【Mayuri】Finally, Mayu... ...shii was...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1C)
【Mayuri】usefull... to... Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E76)
So this... is what she meant...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E90)
【Mayuri】So, I don't want you to make a painful face again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA0)
【Rintaro】...understood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB0)
If she's going to say that much. If she's going to think about me that much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC0)
I'll tell her everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F60)
I let go of Mayuri's hand, and pat the sofa with a pomf.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F70)
【Rintaro】Sit down here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB8)
Mayuri does just as she's told, and sits next to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC8)
【Mayuri】Umm, can I have some snacks?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD8)
【Rintaro】You just can't read the atmosphere, can you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF2)
【Mayuri】That's true...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001002)
Mayuri puts both hands on her lap, straightening herself up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001012)
【Mayuri】Then, go ahead-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001022)
【Rintaro】...What I'm about to say is all true. It's related to the dreams you saw.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001032)
【Rintaro】And, after this, I plan to sacrifice a comrade, for your sake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
【Mayuri】Eh... Okarin...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
When I see anxiety cloud Mayuri's face, I hold her chin with my fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106C)
A switch inside of me was already flipped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107C)
【Rintaro】Hehehe, hehhehhe, better give your sincere repentance. For the dreadful deeds of this insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, are numerous! Fuuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A2)
What's evil is all the inhuman deeds done by this mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B2)
That's how I began to speak.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C2)
Starting with how Moeka and the Rounders first attacked the lab and how Mayuri was killed there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D2)
I spoke about Suzuha, Faris, Lukako, and also about Moeka, FB, and Nae.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E2)
And then finally... I spoke about Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001262)
【Rintaro】In short, by sacrificing Makise Kurisu, I will begin a journey to a new world!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001272)
The explanation was long and went off on many tangents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001282)
Furthermore, Mayuri wasn't used to this sort of conversation, so she kept eagerly asking question after question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001292)
Thanks to that, the conversation became quite long, and it got this late before I knew it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A2)
【Rintaro】And that is my, Hououin Kyouma's magnificently devised plan, codename "World Chaotification"! Fuuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B2)
Haah, finally, the explanation's over...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001306)
【Mayuri】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001316)
Mayuri looked like she was about to cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001326)
She was looking down, firmly clenching the hands placed on her lap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001336)
【Rintaro】...Why the long face?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001346)
【Mayuri】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001356)
Mayuri waggles her head back and forth while biting her lip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001366)
【Mayuri】Both Okarin and Chris-chan, have been suffering, haven't you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001376)
【Mayuri】And yet Mayushii's been making costumes without a care...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001386)
【Mayuri】Like a fool...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001396)
【Mayuri】Mayushii didn't know any of this...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A6)
【Rintaro】You, you don't need to feel responsible. Because everything's going just as I planned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B6)
【Rintaro】...Are you disillusioned, Mayuri? Sorry, but I'm a man who's perfectly fine with sacrificing his comrades.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C6)
【Rintaro】You'll be my hostage, and stay with me until the very end, you know. Kukuku!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D6)
【Rintaro】May chaos come to the world! This too is the Steins;Gate's choice!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F2)
But before that performance of mine could ripen, Mayuri softly stands up, and starts to leave the lab with unsteady feet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014BE)
Confused, I grab her wrist and detain her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014CE)
【Rintaro】H-hey, where are you going!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014DE)
【Mayuri】I need... to see Chris-chan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F8)
【Mayuri】Please, Okarin. I want to see Chris-chan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001508)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001518)
I just couldn't refuse Mayuri's request as she clinged onto me.
<FILEEND71>
