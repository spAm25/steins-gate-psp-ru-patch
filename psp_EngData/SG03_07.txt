#WRITE(PTR, $00000216)
【Rintaro】Nn... ugh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000226)
Disturbed by the melody, I slowly open up my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000236)
What comes into view isn't the stars shining in the cosmos, but the familiar lab ceiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000246)
Ugh, what a bad dream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000256)
What time is it now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000266)
It's bright outside the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000358)
It rang again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000376)
My phone tells me I got another mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000394)
So it's this sound that dares disturb people's sleep, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CA)
That mail demon again...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DA)
I thought I demanded her not to send them so frequently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000500)
I blankly stare at my phone's flickering display.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000510)
My body and mind are dull.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000520)
Don't want to move a step.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000530)
Don't want to think a thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000540)
That feeling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000588)
The incoming mail melody chimes again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000598)
Still not checking it, I sink my body into the sofa--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060E)
A reserved knock resounds from the entryway door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000061E)
Next comes a muffled voice from across the door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000062E)
I couldn't quite catch what it said, but it seems like a woman's voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000063E)
Don't tell me, is the mail sender there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000064E)
Well, there's only one person who'd send me mails this frequently after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000666)
I get up from the sofa just a bit annoyed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070C)
Checking the clock, it's 9 AM. Meaning I've slept for over 15 hours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071C)
I overslept, yet I'm sleepy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000792)
I stifle my yawn while unlocking the door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
【Moeka】Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
When I open the door, I see Shining Finger-- Kiryuu Moeka-- standing there, looking down at her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
【Rintaro】I was asleep....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000864)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000874)
She faintly bows her head without any expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000884)
Aren't you supposed to at least greet me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008FA)
I don't have a problem standing out here the whole time, but I reluctantly invite her in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090A)
I'm still half asleep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091A)
Not minding Moeka, I collapse onto the sofa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000962)
Even though I invited her in, Moeka just stands in the corner of the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000097C)
【Moeka】...Sweaty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098C)
【Rintaro】Hmph, what. I just had a little taste of what it's like to be a particle drifting through space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
No, don't tell me that bad dream was...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3A)
Maybe I'm more shocked at the truth of SERN's experiments than I thought I was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
At any rate, I feel disoriented since I just got up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5A)
My vision's a little hazy too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABE)
I feel like yawning again. I fail to stifle it this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACE)
【Rintaro】So... did you really come to see the IBN 5100?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE8)
Moeka stiffly nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B02)
Then she starts entering something on her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAE)
Why does she have to talk through mail even when we're face to face?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCC)
I've never seen anyone do something like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEA)
Maybe... is the reason they call the Shining Finger ability an evil power...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C08)
She didn't say that. No, she didn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D38)
Certainly, what she said is true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D52)
But if you're going to come, don't you usually tell the person Okay, then, I'll come by at ○○ tommorrow at least a day beforehand?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF0)
【Rintaro】I can show you... but you didn't have to come so early in the morning...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
【Rintaro】No, wait...!? Your true goal is to do an article on me, isn't it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA4)
Back when we first met too, she took a picture of my face without permission.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB4)
Since I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, who travels the world over, material on me is quite delicious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC4)
They say that several countries have been blown away in the past just by my disclosure of the dark sides of international governments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED4)
Though of course, I am being chased by the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE4)
That's why I refuse all interviews and photo ops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF4)
This woman came along, aiming to get me when I'm still disoriented from getting up!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F04)
An excellent plan for a mass media member, a dirty trick for a human.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F68)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F78)
But Moeka doesn't show any reaction from my sharp accusation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F88)
Am I wrong...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9C)
【Rintaro】I'm not looking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B6)
Moeka's shoulders tremble.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C6)
【Rintaro】What sort of idiots would exchange mail when they're right in front of each other?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D6)
And right now, I don't have any energy to look at each and every mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E6)
【Rintaro】Ask verbally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001100)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001110)
Moeka says nothing, and just stares at her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001120)
She doesn't look my way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001130)
I see her faintly stiffen her cheeks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001140)
She's probably daunted by my, Hououin Kyouma's aura of wickedness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001150)
Understandable. For I am he who desires chaos, fuhahaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000116E)
【Moeka】...okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001186)
Looks like she feels like talking now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001196)
But the single word okay? is simply ambiguous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A6)
【Rintaro】Ask in a way I can understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D0)
I notice Moeka quickly looking around the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E0)
【Moeka】I want to see... the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F0)
【Rintaro】...Fine. But you can only look. After you look, you go home. Is that okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001200)
No matter what, I won't sell it or lend it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001210)
Because we need this to complete our perfect hacking operation against SERN, the enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000122A)
Moeka bites her lip at my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123A)
But she soon nods faintly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C6)
I open the curtains to the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D6)
At the edge of the room lies the cardboard box with the IBN 5100 inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E6)
【Rintaro】That cardboard box over there. It's inside that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F6)
I point to it by jerking my chin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000136C)
Moeka slowly walks up to the cardboard box, readies herself, and peeks inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B4)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C4)
She reacts as if laying eyes upon treasure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
She keeps looking at it in fascination.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
She shows no signs of examining it in more detail, nor of taking it out of the box.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F4)
Maybe she's not just an editorial part-timer, but also a retro PC maniac?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001404)
Or maybe she's even a pervert with a retro PC fetish?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001414)
No way. Under no circumstances do I want to live in the same world as perverts of that level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142E)
So, after stiffening for a while, Moeka cheerfully starts another mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D0)
Tch, such an annoying woman...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EE)
Besides, it's not really something that'll compel me to take my phone out and open the mail screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150C)
Honestly speaking, it's not worth it to read the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152A)
It would be over in a second if she just talked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165A)
【Rintaro】No photography without permission. Tell me what sort of camera you're going to use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
The IBN 5100 is our secret weapon against SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167A)
And unless I set up a photograph licensing system, my face may very well appear in the edges of the pictures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168A)
Since I'm being chased by the Organization, I can't expose my face to the media.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A4)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B4)
Moeka stops moving once I give her my instructions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C4)
【Rintaro】No, that's fine. Just place the camera you're going to use on the shelves inside. Show it to me. Okay? No funny business.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D4)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001724)
Moeka silently places her phone on the shelf.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001734)
But she doesn't let go. She keeps her hand on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001744)
【Rintaro】...Don't tell me, is that it? You're going to shoot with that phone's internal camera?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001754)
Moeka nods, still expressionless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001764)
I thought she was doing an editorial article for sure, but using her phone as her press camera is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
Silence flows through.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
Unable to calm down, Moeka looks down at my feet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B2)
【Moeka】...Mail
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
【Rintaro】Ask verbally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017DC)
Moeka stays silent, and for some reason, slowly raises her phone above the cardboard box.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001852)
【Rintaro】H-hey, what are you doing!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001862)
That was clearly a shutter sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001872)
Meaning she took a picture!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001882)
I snap both hands at Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001892)
【Rintaro】Don't move! Do as I say. Slowly place your phone on the shelf inside. Do it now! Make any strange movements and you'll pay for it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AC)
Fortunately, Moeka complies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018FC)
She obediently places her phone on the shelf.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190C)
But she doesn't let go. She keeps her hand on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191C)
【Rintaro】Why did you take a picture?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192C)
【Moeka】...I wanted to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193C)
【Rintaro】You could've asked for permission. Why didn't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001956)
【Moeka】I asked, by mail...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001966)
So that was the last mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001976)
【Rintaro】Oh, is that so. Ask verbally...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001986)
But why did she take a picture...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001996)
Ah, I see. That reminds me, she said she was a part-timer at an editorial company.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A6)
So that means the photo's for an article?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019B6)
But, taking an article picture with a phone camera...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019CA)
She really seems to be fatally lacking in mass media talent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DA)
Or maybe she's too nervous about doing an article on me that she forgot her crucial camera?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EA)
At any rate, this is getting pitiful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A02)
【Rintaro】OK. I don't mind if you take as many pictures as you want. On one condition. Not face shots. If you do shoot me, I won't just silence you--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A1C)
【Moeka】I won't take pictures. Not of Okabe-kun's face...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2C)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADE)
Moeka quickly starts shooting inside the box.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEE)
She doesn't notice me, Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AFE)
Hmph. You may have desperately denied it, but I can tell you want to shoot me, Shining Finger. Did you think you could deceive my eye?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B1A)
My photograph sells at an eye-popping price.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2A)
I should probably consider myself as the true target of this woman's editorial article.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B3A)
But I won't be exposed so easily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B4A)
I'm sorry for Moeka, but I still can't let the Organization find me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B66)
I've always been escaping with my life on the line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B76)
That's why I can say this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B86)
That I leave no trace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
And that I'm vigilant around the clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
That's the worldly wisdom I've learned in life so far.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC2)
At any rate, Shining Finger is shooting to her heart's content.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD2)
She doesn't pay attention to me at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE2)
Tch, she dares shred my pride... this woman.
