A quantum theory approach to explaining the Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment without Einstein's deterministic perspective.<LINE>
It's thought that before the box is opened, the cat's condition is superpositioned between "living" and "dead".<LINE>
The instant the box is opened and observed, the wave function collapses to either condition.<LINE>
If the cat is alive upon opening the box, then the truth retroactively becomes "the cat was alive before the box was opened".<LINE>
Conversely, if the cat is dead, the truth becomes "the cat was dead before the box was opened".<LINE>
On the other hand, through the same quantum theory approach comes another interpretation-- by the many-worlds interpretation, the observer who observed the cat living inside the box, and the observer who observed the cat dead inside the box can be thought of as superpositioned and then diverging.<LINE>
In current quantum theory, this Copenhagen interpretation is the standard school of thought.

A cat is placed inside a box installed with a poisonous gas release system and radioactive radium.<LINE>
If the radium emits an alpha particle, it sets off a sensor, releasing the poisonous gas and killing the cat.<LINE>
Let's say radium has a 50％ chance of alpha particle emission in one hour.<LINE>
After that hour, the moment one opens the box, the cat has a 1:1 likelihood of being alive or dead.<LINE>

Experimental equipment that accelerates various charged particles into collision for the purpose of researching the resulting reactions.<LINE>
The type of particle accelerated also determines the naming scheme of the equipment.<LINE>
In recent years, most high energy accelerators have been synchrotrons - ring types.<LINE>
Ring type accelerators require high costs for their large-scale construction, but they can perform the most efficient collision experiments.<LINE>
The reason for the ring shape is because charged particles can be sent through an electromagnetic field to bend their tragectory through the Lorentz force.<LINE>
The main synchrotrons, other than SERN's LHC, are located in the US, the UK, and Japan.

The problem that could have been possibly caused by old computers once the year 2000 would come.<LINE>
In order to save memory space on old computers, years were almost always abbreviated to the final two digits.<LINE>
Because of that, once 1999 changed to 2000, the last two digits would change from 99 to 00.<LINE>
If its programming didn't anticipate that change, the computer could erroneously assume the year was 1900.<LINE>
It was hypothesized that the computers used in the realms of the military, finance, and utilities would malfunction and cause the worst-case scenario.<LINE>
To address this issue, counter-measures were taken in the mid 1990s to manually update every program.<LINE>
As a result of this counter measure, the Year 2000 Problem ended as nothing but needless fear.

Children are learning about the Internet through this anime. It has reached the point where some scholars claim that children are better informed than their parents with regard to Internet issues. People are even calling this new generation "RaiNet Children".<LINE>
Some politicians and organizations have strongly criticized the series for "encouraging children to become hikikomori" by idealizing boys and girls who are obsessed with computers. However, a majority of adults praise the series for teaching children about the Internet, Internet morality, copyright infringement, and privacy protection.<LINE>
The series is not merely an educational program. As Kakeru battles terrorists in cyberspace, his techniques are represented as virtual robots while his enemies' viruses take the form of monsters. This makes the confrontations easy to visualize, with well-timed perspective changes depicting both the protagonist's techniques inside the computer, and his friends' teamwork outside the computer.

Does not refer to actual teleportation.<LINE>
In 2004, Japanese researchers made their first successful "complete quantum leap experiment".<LINE>
Suppose we have twin particles(photons in this case), A and B. Since they are twins, they have the property of symmetry; if one is spinning face up, the other is spinning face down.<LINE>
Meaning observation of either A or B allows one to know the status of both without observing the other one. This is called entanglement.<LINE>
The state of an elementary particle(photon) cannot be confirmed until observed.<LINE>
Several states overlap; the state is "undetermined" until observation.<LINE>
We can use entanglement, and attach Data C, the information we want to teleport, to Photon A with the observation equipment. By observing this entangled state, that is, "AC", we can be assured that no matter how far away B is, we can decide its state as "BC".<LINE>
(At this point, B has not been observed) Afterwards, once we send Photon AC's information from A's observation equipment to B's observation equipment through traditional transmissions, observing Photon B changes it to "Photon BC".<LINE>
This process is called quantum teleportation because Data C actually teleports. However, since one step requires using traditional information transmission, it is impossible for the information to exceed the speed of light.<LINE>
Finally, Photon BC's "teleported" Data C is actually a copy of Photon AC's Data C. The whereabouts of the original Photon C become unknown.<LINE>
This point differentiates quantum teleportation from actual teleportation.
