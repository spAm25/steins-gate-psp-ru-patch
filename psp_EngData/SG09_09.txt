#WRITE(PTR, $000007DC)
Moeka and I planned to break into Manager's house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EC)
I had Kurisu stand guard outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007FC)
Or so I say, but we don't illegally trespass or anything, just honestly use the doorbell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000080C)
And Manager appears immediately, bringing us into the living room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AC)
I go look at the Divergence Meter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F8)
Its numbers display 0.523307％.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000908)
Still a long way before we get over 1％. That makes me feel a little impatient.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000918)
【Tennoji】You came at a great time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000096C)
Tennouji isn't angry that we came so early, but is welcoming us with a smile instead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000097C)
He even starts preparing us instant coffee.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098C)
【Rintaro】You're up pretty early, huh, Mister Braun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099C)
【Tennoji】I guess. I need to match Nae's school hours, so waking up early is essential.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AC)
【Tennoji】It's summer break now, but it's already become a habit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BC)
【Rintaro】Is your daughter still asleep?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D6)
【Tennoji】Shut up. What are you planning, asking about Nae like that? If you attack her in her sleep, I'll seriously kill you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
【Rintaro】I won't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
I'm more interested in this guy's wife.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A06)
We spent time inside the house like this, but we haven't seen her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A16)
Is she still sleeping like Nae?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A26)
Or maybe she's hiding down in the cellar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A36)
I'd like to search this house at full force, but of course that's impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A46)
But what concerns me is how Manager talked just now--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A56)
It sounded like he was a single father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A66)
The person most likely to be FB is Manager's wife.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A76)
But I might be making a grave assumption.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A86)
Manager might just be a mere courier after all, and not know anything about FB.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A96)
There's the possibility that FB might not even be here in Akiba in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA6)
I'm stumped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB6)
I need to make sure, but how should I say it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFE)
Moeka's been hanging her head for a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0E)
I can't count on this woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2A)
Whether or not Manager's wife is FB, I don't think tricks will work against him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3A)
So I challenge him directly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4A)
【Rintaro】A few hours ago, six men assembled in front of this house, took a certain something and flew to France. Obviously, you know, don't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5A)
Instead of his usual cursing, Manager smiles gently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B74)
【Tennoji】And that is?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B84)
【Rintaro】...the IBN 5100. You should know about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B94)
【Tennoji】The phantom retro PC, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA4)
It's so anticlimactic that he admits it so easily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB4)
Manager seems like a different person today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC4)
【Rintaro】Just what are you? A courier perhaps, or maybe--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD4)
【Rintaro】A Rounder?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEE)
【Tennoji】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C36)
Manager said no more, but instead shifted focus to Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C56)
【Tennoji】Did you betray us? M4?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2C)
【Moeka】...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3C)
Moeka's whole body twitched.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4C)
That was something only FB should know about, Moeka's codename.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5C)
【Moeka】Don't tell me... F...B...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E66)
Manager smiled wryly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E76)
【Tennoji】Do you know who Ferdinand Braun is?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E86)
Being asked such an unintelligible question, Moeka and I look at each other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E96)
【Tennoji】Hey, hey, he's the Physics Nobel Prize laureate who invented the Braun Tube, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA6)
I knew this guy liked Braun Tubes since I first met him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB6)
But what does that question have to do with...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC6)
【Tennoji】Ferdinand Braun. Initials?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED6)
【Rintaro】...Ah!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
【Moeka】FB...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6C)
【Tennoji】That's how it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7C)
Tennouji slowly takes out a handgun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8C)
He did it so spontaneously, that at first, I didn't recognize it was a handgun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9C)
A black luster conveying its coldness, a heavy form.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
The muzzle is pointing straight at Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBC)
【Rintaro】Uh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCC)
Suddenly pulling a gun out like that, you can't be...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
Moeka and I are unarmed. I should've planned ahead for something like this...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
I mean, I didn't expect that Manager could be FB.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFC)
I always thought FB was this man's wife.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100C)
【Rintaro】Let me ask one thing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101C)
【Rintaro】Your wife...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102C)
【Tennoji】She died when Nae was born. That all?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
I curse in my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
That's obvious since I've never seen her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
She wasn't around from the start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106C)
I should've known that FB... was a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107C)
【Moeka】No... that can't be...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108C)
【Tennoji】What's next after dependence on me? Escapism?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109C)
Shaking the gun, Manager-- No, Tennouji Yuugo, sneers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AC)
An overwhelming disadvantage. An absolute frontal attack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010BC)
At this rate, it'll end with both Moeka and me dead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CC)
...No, it won't end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DC)
At least, I won't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
The world doesn't want me dead today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FC)
It's guaranteed I won't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000110C)
If you take Attractor Field Theory into consideration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111C)
I, who have already been to the 16th once and time leaped from there, can't possibly die now, early morning on the 15th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000112C)
Paradoxically speaking, I certainly live until the 16th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000113C)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E6)
It's not like that for Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F6)
Today, she will die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001206)
Whether her means of death is suicide or murder doesn't really matter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
Moeka might die here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001226)
I--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129C)
Stop thinking about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012AC)
Now's not the time to think about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012BC)
What's important is to obtain FB's cellphone, and send a D-mail with it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CC)
That is my only goal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001364)
In any case, even though a gun's being pointed, there's no need to freeze in fear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001374)
Now that I've gotten this far, all I can do is an all-out attack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001384)
【Rintaro】So you were a member of the Rounders. You were SERN's dog.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001394)
【Tennoji】A dog, huh. Ya ain't wrong about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A4)
Today, Tennouji is different from usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B4)
A flexible attitude. Even if I provoke him, he doesn't get angry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C4)
On the contrary, he's holding that gun without a shred of tension in his voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
Is this the true face of the man called Tennouji?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
Was the Manager winding tubes at the Braun Tube Workshop all an act?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F4)
【Rintaro】If you shoot, the gunshot will wake your daughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001404)
【Tennoji】So what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001414)
【Rintaro】Do you want your daughter to see you do such a dirty act?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001424)
【Tennoji】My daughter isn't an intolerable girl who judges by appearances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001434)
I grind my teeth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001444)
【Rintaro】Of all things, you're a Rounder...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001454)
【Rintaro】Hashida Suzu didn't look after you just so you could be that...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146A)
【Tennoji】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147A)
Tennouji's smile stiffened for a second.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000148A)
But he soon slaps his knee and starts laughing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A6)
【Tennoji】What's that, you knew about Suzu-san? You shoulda told me sooner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B6)
In this world line, Manager and I haven't talked about Hashida Suzu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C6)
【Tennoji】But you're talking like you know a lot aren't ya? Suzu-san died 10 years ago. Back then, you were just about 8, Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D6)
【Tennoji】But you knew Suzu-san?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
【Rintaro】...I know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F6)
I glare at Tennouji.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001506)
I'm about to explode from frustration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001516)
【Rintaro】In my subjective time, it was just a few weeks since she was here in this era.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161A)
【Suzuha】Changing the future is up to you guys. I'll be sure to bring the package here in Akihabara. Then I'll entrust it to you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162A)
【Suzuha】...Please. I want to change the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001684)
Inside my head. I can still clearly remember Suzuha's words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001694)
Though they feel so long ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A4)
In actual time, they happened just a few days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B4)
【Rintaro】She was always close to you..!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C4)
【Rintaro】Hashida Suzu... no, Amane Suzuha, came to this era to fight SERN, as a time traveler...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D4)
【Tennoji】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E4)
【Tennoji】What...are...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F4)
【Rintaro】You didn't notice, did you, FB? Your benefactor came from the year 2036. She was a member of our lab. Daru's daughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001704)
【Rintaro】Suzuha hated SERN. And yet you, who are indebted to that same Suzuha, are nothing but SERN's dog?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001714)
【Rintaro】You're making Suzuha turn in her grave...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
【Tennoji】Stop spewing bullshit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D2)
Tennouji points the gun at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E2)
I almost flinched, but I endured.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F2)
【Rintaro】...Why did you become like this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001802)
【Tennoji】Shaddup. Stuff happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001812)
Stuff... huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001822)
【Moeka】Are you really... FB...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001832)
Moeka looks at the scene bewildered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001902)
Tennouji sighs and puts the gun down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001912)
【Tennoji】Yeah, I am.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001922)
【Moeka】The mails...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001932)
【Tennoji】I wrote them all. Why use womanly words? Camouflage. To hide my identity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001942)
【Tennoji】Aren't there tons of Guys In Real Life online?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001952)
【Tennoji】Seriously, though. It was dreadful, M4. You send too much mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001962)
【Tennoji】I responded to each of your boring-ass consultations, so show some gratitude.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197C)
【Moeka】No...way...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198C)
【Moeka】FB... was like... a mother... to me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199C)
【Moeka】I'd do anything... for FB...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AC)
【Tennoji】That was the point. It's so easy to manipulate mental cases like you who form dependencies so quickly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019BC)
【Rintaro】...just stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A20)
I approach Tennouji, but freeze once he points the gun at me again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A30)
【Moeka】Why...didn't you... contact me..?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A40)
【Tennoji】Contact? Ahh, once you got the IBN 5100, you were no use to us anymore.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A50)
【Moeka】...no use...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A60)
That was obvious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A70)
I even said so to Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A80)
That Moeka was an abandoned piece.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A90)
And to prove it, Tennouji keeps talking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA0)
Rounders are disposable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB0)
【Tennoji】Recruiting members by direct mail is bad in terms of confidentiality, but that's just how the Rounders roll.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC0)
【Tennoji】And any member who finds an IBN 5100 has done their duty and is silenced. Any member, without exception.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD0)
What...? What is he saying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE0)
【Tennoji】Doing so, SERN and the "committee" can cheaply keep their secrets and use misfits like us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF0)
【Moeka】FB...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B00)
【Tennoji】They see all members of the Rounders as pieces. How sad, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B10)
Tennouji, thinking something or another, takes the gun he has pointed to me--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B64)
【Tennoji】Doing your duty sets you up for "disposal". So we're more like livestock than dogs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B74)
And, while smiling, pushes it to his own temple--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B84)
【Moeka】...Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B94)
【Tennoji】If you defy them, you expose your family to danger. I can't let them touch my precious daughter, can I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA4)
【Rintaro】Hey, stop this--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB4)
【Tennoji】I feel bad for Suzu-san--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC4)
【Tennoji】Really, I do wonder why things turned out like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C88)
Without time to stop him--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF2)
【Moeka】Ah...ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F02)
【Rintaro】Wh...y...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F12)
Blood. Brains.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F22)
Scatter to the wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F32)
Tennouji's burly body... lies down without moving a twitch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F42)
A blood red stain gradually spreads over the tatami mat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F52)
Dead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F62)
Tennouji is dead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F8C)
【Moeka】No... why...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA4)
 uugh ughwooehh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC4)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD4)
Everything ended unintelligibly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FE4)
Without us doing anything, Tennouji had done his duty and disposed of himself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FF4)
Today, has the will of the world recognized Tennouji's death?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002004)
【Rintaro】You're... an idiot...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002306)
I strongly bite my lip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002316)
I pound my fists on the floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002326)
【Rintaro】How could you leave your daughter and just die on your own...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002336)
He said it was to protect his daughter, but just what should that daughter do from now on?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002346)
【Rintaro】Moreover, why... did you smile when you died...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002466)
All Rounder members are disposable? Sacrificial pieces?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002476)
Not just Moeka, but even FB is a mere sacrificial piece?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002486)
That's how SERN works?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002496)
This is just messed up...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A6)
It's too disconnected from reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B6)
Is Nae... still sleeping in the next room?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C6)
Not knowing her father died?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002546)
How can I explain this to his daughter...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002556)
Should I run?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002566)
Again, strictly, my purpose is to obtain FB's phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002576)
And then if I change the world line by sending a D-mail, the present will be reconstructed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002586)
So there's no need to shoulder the unpleasant responsibilities.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002596)
Run away. To run away is to be called a coward.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025A6)
Everything's going to be undone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025B6)
Yet I.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C6)
I timidly open the sliding door to the next room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002628)
Just as I thought, it's a child's room. There's a red backpack hanging next to the desk, and a futon is laid out.

But Nae isn't there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002648)
The window is open, and the lace curtains are waving as if to invite the fresh morning breeze inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002658)
【Rintaro】...she's gone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002668)
Where did... she go?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002678)
Where did that kid... go...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002688)
Don't tell me she was kidnapped by SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002698)
Or was she gone before we came here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A8)
I don't know...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026B8)
This is all so unexpected, I don't know what to think.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E0)
【Rintaro】Let's look for... his phone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F0)
Manager's phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000278E)
I'm relieved Nae isn't here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000279E)
I don't have to tell her about her father's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027AE)
Manager's phone was in his pants pocket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027BE)
In any case, I was thinking about stealing it during the entire lookout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CE)
If he resisted, I'd have the conviction to steal it even if I had to kill him, just like Kurisu said before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027DE)
But I never thought--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027EE)
That he'd die before I killed him...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027FE)
And now, like a hyena scavenging fresh flesh, I'm stealing the possessions of the recently deceased. I make myself want to puke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002926)
I couldn't find Nae after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002936)
After getting Manager's phone, I carry the paralyzed Moeka on my shoulders, leaving the Tennouji residence as if running away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002946)
We regroup with Kurisu, who was waiting worried outside, and hail a taxi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002956)
If we had left the rental car parked close to that house, there's a possibility we'd become prime suspects.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002966)
We should've properly reported it to the police, but we avoided getting asked the annoying details.
