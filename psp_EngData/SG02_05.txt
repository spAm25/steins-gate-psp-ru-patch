【Itaru】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F4)
20 minutes have passed since Daru began hacking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000804)
Daybreak. A refreshing summer morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000814)
I peek at Daru's condition while browsing @channel on my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
His typing speed has already become that of a piston.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
His feet move up and down in an accompaniment with the rattatattat of his keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
He hasn't slept in about 40 hours, but Daru still won't separate from his computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
I wanted to ask him if he'd like a break, but hesitated. His entire body exuded an aura that said Don't talk to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086C)
I curl myself up a bit and look back down on my phone screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087C)
The discussions with John Titor don't quite fit together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088C)
It looks like not even Titor himself knows about the Titor of ten years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089C)
It's hard to imagine that everyone on @channel except me is conspiring.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AC)
But isn't that just baffling?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DE)
So with that said, I do as Titor requested and start to mail him directly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008EE)
He audaciously exposed his own address on @channel. I guess this means he's accepted their challenge!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D6)
In the mail, I question the differences in his posts from 10 years ago and now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
He doesn't seem to be in contact with the Titor who posted 10 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
I only vaguely remember it, but it went primarily like this:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A94)
・ 2015, World War III breaks out, many people die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B32)
・ In 2036, the world is contaminated from nuclear warfare
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
・ He time traveled from 2036 to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100. Its purpose was to revive technology lost in World War III.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6E)
・ The IBN 5100 has a hidden function. The ability to debug IBN's special proprietary computer language before APL and BASIC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
・ But the only ones who know that fact are certain IBN engineers, so this function does not appear in the manual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAA)
・ In 1998, Titor met his young self and his parents from his early life in America.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E48)
・ Titor aspired to be a time traveler as a soldier.&
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE6)
・ Titor is an American.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F84)
Furthermore, several future events that Titor posted about in 2000 came true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F94)
The Peruvian coast earthquake in 2001, the election of a new pope, the outbreak of the Iraq War, China's advances in space, and so forth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA4)
Though he talked about all of them vaguely, they all came true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB4)
On the other hand, others failed to come true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCC)
For example, the <DICT>Year 2000 Problem</DICT>, civil war in America, the cancellation of the Beijing Olympics, the inauguration of the America's first female president in 2009, and so forth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
There are others, but let's leave them aside for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
Let's ask him why those predictions didn't come true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DC)
Alright, now let's send it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001274)
If he doesn't answer honestly, then the current Titor who descended onto @channel is an imposter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001284)
This is your litmus test, John Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001294)
Heheheh, now, what color will you yield?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130A)
【Mayuri】Tutturu-♪ Good morning
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B8)
Mayuri comes in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C8)
She's smiling now, as if she had been cleared of her resentment over her food yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D8)
【Rintaro】What are you doing here this early?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F2)
【Mayuri】Well, I heard you guys had stayed up two nights in a row, so I brought you provisions-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001402)
【Rintaro】I see. Thanks for your troubles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001412)
To be accurate, I took a nap yesterday, so it wasn't two nights in a row, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
Mayuri starts fishing through her convenience store bag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F6)
And then she takes out--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001518)
【Mayuri】Tada-h. <DICT>Canned oden</DICT>!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001528)
The canned oden is still warm when she gives it to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001538)
Right away, I open the lid and eat the beef.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001548)
Since Mayuri and I have been together for a long time, she knows what I like.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001558)
I like beef in my oden the best.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001568)
【Mayuri】It's a present from Mayushii-. They're 270 yen each, so savor it, okay-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001578)
【Rintaro】Lately, I've been getting tired of eating bananas and karaage. Please include this in your provisions from now on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001592)
【Mayuri】But Mayushii doesn't have enough pocket money to be that extravagant all the time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AC)
【Mayuri】Also, Mayushii loves bananas and karaage, so she'll keep buying them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BC)
Mmgh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CC)
The complaint "You'll get fat if you only eat frozen foods" came to mind, but I dare not say it since it's not very effective against Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DC)
She has the metabolism to not get fat no matter how much she eats.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F6)
【Mayuri】And, there's more. Here, tada~h♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163E)
What she takes out next is a small box with a RaiNet illustration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164E)
【Mayuri】RaiNet sausage. You know it comes with an Upa bottle cap as an added bonus-. I really wanted it, so I bought it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
She sticks out her tongue with an 'eheh'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167A)
Let's try to make a prediction. In a few months, this lab will be filled with Upa goods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168A)
It all started with that cushion siting on the sofa, but the number is sure to go through exponential growth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001740)
【Mayuri】So, how's Daru-kun~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E4)
【Rintaro】In the midst of a hard fight. He should at least rest a little. I mean, I never said he ha to do it all at once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
【Mayuri】Daru-kun's supah hakah spirit is burning up ablaze, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192C)
【Itaru】Over there, don't say hakah!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D0)
An empty diet cola bottle comes flying with a whistle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D20)
It hits my head with a thunk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC4)
【Mayuri】He sure is tense-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F2C)
Mayuri and I evacuate to a corner of the lounge and quietly eat the oden.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD0)
【Mayuri】But- hacking is bad, isn't it-? Mayushii doesn't want you to do bad things like that-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002074)
【Rintaro】Letting Daru's supah hakah... I mean, hacker skill go to waste is like throwing pearls before swine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002118)
By the way, it seems like SERN's system got hijacked by hackers in 2008 too. When we searched online, we got news hits talking about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021BC)
Basically, that means that even the people who developed the world wide web have security holes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002260)
With Daru's level of skill, he should have no trouble to penetrate such a security hole.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002304)
【Rintaro】Besides, this is to disclose the wrongdoings of SERN. This is the war against the huge darkness that rules the world from behind!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B2)
【Mayuri】Bad things are bad-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002456)
Mm? Unlike usual, Mayuri seriously believes what I said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024FA)
Well, I know we're doing a bad thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259E)
But while that may be true, there's no way we can stop now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002654)
I need to change the subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000266C)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, want to trade my sweet potatos for your beef?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000268A)
【Mayuri】Ehh-?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A4)
 In that case, I'd rather have your quail egg-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026B8)
【Rintaro】Don't be ridiculous. After beef, I like quail eggs the best.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D2)
【Mayuri】Mayushii likes quail eggs too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
【Rintaro】Settle for my chikuwa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002700)
【Mayuri】Mm-, okay-.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000271A)
 Chikuwa's better than sweet potatoes-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000272E)
With that said, I skewer the chikuwa and put in Mayuri's can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000273E)
In return, I take out her beef.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274E)
And now the subject change is complete. Mayuri really eats up conversations about food. It's so easy to lead her on. Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002764)
【Itaru】Soon... If I can just get the SQL table, I'll have more than enough passwords... gweheheh... don't underestimate me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CC)
Daru starts mumbling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027DC)
Looks like things are slowly settling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027F0)
Daru's really is a supah hakah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002800)
It feels like this is the first time I've seen him serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002810)
Daru bends himself forward, staring holes into the screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002820)
But all that's on the screen is the same string of numbers and letters...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002830)
【Itaru】Ohoh, gotitgotitgot it-, good, good, yes, prepare yourself. Everything is exposed before me. How does it feel to be naked? Hyahha-, ha, haha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002840)
His eyes are completely bloodshot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002850)
And he's muttering some creepy monologue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002860)
Maybe he's got some strange enthusiasm from lack of sleep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002870)
Daru opens up a new window, types in a 12 letter word(?), and slams down the enter key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288C)
An error sound rings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000289C)
Then he quickly deletes the string and enters in a new one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B8)
He keeps repeating that action and then--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291E)
【Itaru】...Ohh, got it! Got it-----! Matching ID and password! Login complete, fuck yeah! Die! Don't underestimate me! YESYESYES!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292E)
H-how enthusiastic of him...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000293E)
【Rintaro】Daru, did you get it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A8)
That smug bastard turns around at my voice, with a shining, refreshed face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C0)
As if he had gone into <DICT>le petite mort</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D0)
【Itaru】Mission Complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E0)
【Rintaro】Really!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A28)
【Mayuri】Wah-, that's amazing-. Don't know what that is, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A38)
After 20 hours of agony, it's finally over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A48)
To show Daru my appreciation, I hurl an unopened oden can at him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A98)
【Itaru】An oden can after a job well done is the best.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA8)
【Rintaro】Good job. You really are the world's best supah haka--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC2)
【Itaru】Hacker.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AD2)
【Rintaro】H-hacker. I'm glad you're not my enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE2)
【Rintaro】So, did you find evidence on the world destruction project?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AFC)
【Itaru】No, nothing yet-. I only connected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B0C)
【Itaru】Well, it's all downhill from here, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B1C)
【Rintaro】In that case, I'm sorry if you're tired, but please get check up on it at once. It's got to be in there. Shadows of conspiracy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B36)
【Itaru】Yeah, yeah, I'll do it. But before that, let me eat the oden can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C5A)
After a short meal break, Daru taps on his keyboard more nimbly than before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA2)
【Itaru】The problem is the who this password belongs to, and their position in SERN, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CEA)
【Mayuri】What do you mean-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D04)
【Itaru】I went into SERN's database and got a data table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D14)
【Itaru】From there, I focused on people with simple passwords like 11111111 and ABCDEFGH to obtain an ID.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D2E)
【Itaru】It's best if the owner of that ID were a server manager, but I don't think we'd be that lucky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D48)
【Mayuri】In Japanese please-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D58)
【Rintaro】Same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D72)
【Itaru】If it's a server manager's password, then we could lick the entirety of SERN's body, but if it's an ordinary researcher, then we could only see its boobs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D82)
【Mayuri】Daru-kun, that's naughty-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D92)
【Rintaro】Don't use erotic examples. Basically, you mean the information we can see will be limited, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DAC)
【Itaru】Exactly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DC6)
【Itaru】Well, getting a server manager's password would only be a matter of time. Let's save that for later. I'm really sleepy now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DE0)
It would be cruel to push Daru any further.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF0)
It's unfortunate, but it can't be helped. Let's let him rest so he can be refreshed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E0C)
【Itaru】Ohh, looks like the ID we got belongs to an accelerator division official.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E1C)
【Rintaro】It's not a server manager then...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E64)
【Itaru】It would take a miracle to get one with our first try. How many staff members do you think SERN has?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EAC)
【Mayuri】How many?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EBC)
【Itaru】Over 6000.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ED6)
There's that many...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EF2)
【Itaru】Well, for now, this accelerator division official, uh his name is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F02)
【Itaru】Mr. Jack. Let's peep into his mail log.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F12)
As expected, the mails come up in English.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F5A)
【Mayuri】Uwawah-. Mayushii's head is starting to hurt...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6A)
Hmph. It's miserable to be flinching at the sight of English.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F86)
【Rintaro】Daru, what's written there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F96)
【Itaru】Need to translate it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FAE)
【Rintaro】Angle up the <DICT>Babel Fish</DICT>!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FBE)
【Itaru】I'm not gonna do something tedious like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FCE)
Daru boots up translation software and auto-translates the open page.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FDE)
Poor, unnatural Japanese shows up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FEE)
The first line said A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FFE)
【Itaru】Greeting like of New Year it does the~. Go on vacation in Spain... envy
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000300E)
That mail's contents were normal. Nothing out of the ordinary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000301E)
【Itaru】If we keep scouring the log like this, we can also identify the server manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003066)
【Mayuri】You know, looking through someone else's mail without permission makes me feel really sorry....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003150)
Mayuri gets depressed and moves away from the computer out of guilt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003160)
She silently sits on the sofa and sighs as she hugs the giant Upa cushion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003170)
What we're doing certainly is socially unacceptable. I recognize that. But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031E0)
【Rintaro】Having stepped foot on the path of evil long ago, I no longer know what guilt feels like, fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031F0)
【Rintaro】I shall take all responsibility. I have no intention to get either of you charged with guilt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003238)
【Itaru】Uhoh. I'd let Okarin do me in the butt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003248)
【Rintaro】I decline.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003262)
【Rintaro】So with that said, Daru, don't hesitate to peek.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003306)
【Mayuri】Okarin, you're bad-. Mayushii's a sad panda.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003316)
That's of no concern to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003326)
Don't be a hypocrite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033D2)
Upon further examination, we discover several mails with the title Experiment report.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033E2)
Which means "実験報告" in Japanese.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033F2)
Looks like he sends this mail almost daily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003402)
【Rintaro】LHC experiment reports, huh. There could be a time machine hint in there. We should try opening it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003412)
【Itaru】It seems dangerous to look at it, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003422)
Daru says so while clicking that mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003432)
What came out is a cryptic series of symbols.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003442)
【Itaru】This is encrypted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003452)
【Rintaro】Tch, so it really wasn't that simple...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003462)
【Itaru】Well, it'll be a piece of cake to solve this level of encryption.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003472)
Nice, supah hakah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003482)
He's no doubt a genius.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034BA)
In about 10 minutes, Daru's undone the security.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034CA)
What takes more time is deciphering the confusingly translated Japanese.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000351E)
【Itaru】Umm, liberally translated...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003584)
【Itaru】"Hi, Pole"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003630)
【Rintaro】That acting's unnecessary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000364A)
【Itaru】Ya think so...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B2)
【Itaru】"Uploaded today's experimental data to the server. The LHC's condition is excellent. Though, it is the "LHC' to the end."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C2)
【Itaru】"It's almost fickle like a cat, but it was surprisingly obedient this month. It would be great if it stayed in this condition forever."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D2)
【Itaru】"But don't you think this work isn't rewarding? This kitten-- or should I say large cat HAHAHAHA-- has been in operation for 9 years."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E2)

【Itaru】"In all actuality, if it was officially announced, it would become a scandal, don't you think?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003702)
【Itaru】"Those guys around the world would probably say this: "Call Robert Zemeckiff to SERN right away. Then you could get him to make it in less than a year"."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003712)
【Rintaro】...9 years?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003722)
I rub my temples with my thumbs, waiting for Daru to finish reading.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003732)
Calm down. Sort it out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003792)
【Rintaro】Do you think there were any translation mistakes in that mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A2)
Does Daru notice something unnatural too? He's not joking like usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037EA)
【Itaru】If you believe in the translation software, there shouldn't be any mistakes, right? The Japanese certainly is strange here and there, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037FA)
【Rintaro】But something's weird then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000380A)
【Rintaro】The LHC should've only been put into operation around spring last year. But if you read between the lines in this mail, it's been in operation for 9 years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003824)
【Itaru】That's strange.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038D4)
The mail's send date is this year, 2010, so nine years ago is 2001.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038E4)
Yesterday on @channel, John Titor posted this:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F4)
"If you want to supplement that explanation, then you have no choice but to believe what they say."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003904)
"They have already succeeded at the creation of micro-black holes."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003914)
I gulp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003924)
If you read between the lines in this mail... there's the nuance that they're doing some sort of secret experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003934)
And Robert Zemeckiff is a super-famous Hollywood movie director.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003944)
He directed a trilogy of smash-hit time travel movies about 20 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003954)
I groan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003964)
Don't tell me... my expectations were correct?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003974)
SERN's hiding a major secret from the world?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003984)
And it's even research on time machines, or something related...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E8)
【Rintaro】Daru. Examine it some more. Search for traces of time machine research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A02)
【Itaru】Seriously...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A12)
I don't know if Daru was directing that to my order, or to SERN's secret.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A2E)
Either way, Daru takes my words to heart and begins tapping on the keyboard again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8E)
【Itaru】Hmm, there aren't any mails with the phrase "time machine" in them...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A9E)
【Itaru】But the phrase "Z Program" is used hundreds of times in the past few months.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AAE)
【Itaru】Don't you think it could be the experiments they're doing with the LHC right now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ABE)
【Rintaro】What is it specifically? Black hole formation experiments?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ACE)
【Itaru】Hmmm, let's look for a document... ah, found one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ADE)
Daru opens up a PDF file sent as an attachment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AEE)
【Itaru】Hohoh-, looks like this is top secret stuff from France, England, and Holland.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AFE)
【Rintaro】...top secret national affairs?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B0E)
【Itaru】SERN's not even a national organization, so why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B1E)
【Itaru】Anyway, top secret national affairs? This bad, isn't it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B2E)
【Rintaro】Don't care. Examine the details.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B3E)
【Itaru】No, no. If we get caught, we won't just be sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B4E)
【Rintaro】Are you so incompetent at hacking that you'd get tracked?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B5E)
【Itaru】...I did it in a way that can't be tracked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B6E)
【Rintaro】Then I fail to see a problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B7E)
【Itaru】Well, thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B8E)
Daru makes a slightly awkward face as he feeds a file detailing the Z Program into the translation software.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF4)
【Itaru】Hmm, "May 14 #137th Z Program Experiment Report"...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C04)
【Itaru】
"Because the mission of mini-black hole formation has already been established, the report is omitted. First--"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C14)
【Rintaro】Stop! Stop!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C74)
All of a sudden, Titor's "prediction" became reality...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C84)
【Rintaro】So SERN did use the LHC to successfully generate mini-black holes...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C94)
【Itaru】Officially, they announced that they still haven't succeeded with the experiments, so why...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CA4)
When Titor posted believe what they say, that's what he was referring to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CB4)
【Itaru】In the first place, the experiment's goal was to create new particle reactions, not generate mini-black holes....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CC4)
Daru doesn't take his wide eyes off the monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CD4)
【Rintaro】But in reality, they're already generating mini-black holes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CE4)
【Itaru】Seems like it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CF4)
【Rintaro】What's written after that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D04)
【Itaru】Umm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D64)
【Itaru】"Experimental results: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, consult the enclosed Jellyman's Report No.14."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D74)
【Itaru】"Unless lifter adjustment, as well as each local field conformity position can be fixed, it is proposed that the experiments must be terminated."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D84)
【Rintaro】Wh-what does that mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D94)
【Itaru】Human is dead means that somebody died, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DBC)
【Rintaro】Wha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DCC)
Somebody died?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DDC)
Seriously?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DEC)
I groan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DFC)
Th-this isn't a joke anymore.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E0C)
We've might've gotten involved in something outrageous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E1C)
Maybe we've fallen and we can't get up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E2C)
We've stirred up a hornet's nest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ECA)
Pfft, who gives a damn?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EDA)
I-I'm not afraid. After all, I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EEA)
We can't stop after coming this far.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EFA)
I can't control my curiosity. And watching an actual evil deed take place without doing anything about it just leaves a bad taste.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F0A)
My throat has gone dry from the strain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F1A)
I swallow down my spit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F2A)
In an attempt to keep whatever composure I can, I scold myself for trying to run away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F8E)
【Rintaro】What is this Jellyman's Report?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F9E)
Daru starts typing once I ask my question, but he soon clicks his tongue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FE6)
【Itaru】Well, I can't find it in Mr. Jack's mail. We need to get a hold of a higher up or a server manager's password.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FF6)
【Rintaro】Then we'll postpone that. Search for tings related to time machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004010)
【Itaru】But nothing's going to turn up, you know~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004050)
After that, Daru spends about 15 minutes fishing through the accelerator division official's mail, but can't find anything about time machines after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004098)
【Itaru】Words like accelerator, technical committee, and LHC project official came out, so we should look for an ID from there. Maybe we can get more detailed information.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040A8)
【Rintaro】You can't examine it using Mr. Jack's ID?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B8)
Daru nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C8)
【Rintaro】Well then, let's stop for today...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040E2)
【Itaru】By the way, what we saw just now was SERN's biggest server, but there's actually another one, a strange database.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040F2)
【Rintaro】Strange, in what way?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004102)
【Itaru】...It was buggy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004112)
【Rintaro】Buggy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000412C)
【Itaru】Well, buggy, or rather, something that seemed like program code came up....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004146)
【Itaru】It was too ambiguous and confusing, or rather, utterly impossible to decode, thank you very much, or rather
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004156)
【Rintaro】Could it be encrypted?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004170)
【Itaru】That's not a cipher I've ever seen. It just bothers me as to why they would have a database that nobody could see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004180)
【Rintaro】That does bother me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000419A)
【Itaru】I'll try analyzing it for a bit.
