We immediately started the D-mail experiment, and even though it's before noon, the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s discharge phenomenon still broke out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000654)
Things look favorable today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000664)
By the way, we haven't talked to Manager downstairs yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000674)
Maybe we should think of an excuse beforehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000684)
But this isn't the time to read the owner's expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000694)
Correct, for this is the war against the Organization, otherwise known as SERN, and their conspiracy controlling the world from the shadows!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085E)
【Itaru】<DICT>Anzai-sensei</DICT>, I-I want to eat Faris-tan's home cooking...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000942)
【Mayuri】If you give up, it's game over you know-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A82)
Even with Daru's second D-mail, the past didn't change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B26)
I feel like RaiNet matches are difficult to cheat your way out of in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCA)
Not to mention we're limited to 36 bytes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6E)
Looks like we'll have to give up on Daru, who's started to sulkily surf the net.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D12)
But even if we were to use another lab mem as a test subject, it doesn't look like Kurisu would bend her policy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB6)
Meaning there's only one candidate left.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF2)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, let's have you change the past next.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA0)
【Mayuri】Eh-? Mayushii? It's okay to change it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104E)
【Mayuri】But changing the past... what should I change about it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001104)
Mayuri looks stumped as she slurps her cup ramen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001126)
【Mayuri】Ah, then, how about this-? I'll change the past and have Luka-kun wear Mayushii's costume.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001136)
【Rintaro】How?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001150)
【Mayuri】By sending Luka-kun a mail-♪ Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001160)
That's not changing the past, but just a wish, isn't it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001170)
【Rintaro】You can't think of something more simple, and easy to understand?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118A)
【Mayuri】Hm~mm~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000119A)
She slurps more ramen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AE)
【Rintaro】...Let's use that cup ramen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BE)
Looks like only I can come up with ideas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CE)
【Rintaro】We'll send a D-mail to Mayuri one hour back. I wanna eat cup oden or so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
【Kurisu】I don't think that's simple enough to convince her to--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001230)
【Mayuri】Ah, that might be really good-☆
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000124A)
【Kurisu】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
【Mayuri】Today, when I was in front of the vending machine, I couldn't decide for about ten minutes-.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001282)
 Should I go with cup oden-, or
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129C)
 should I go with cup ramen-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B0)
【Rintaro】Basically, if she was pushed a little, Mayuri would inevitably want to eat cup oden, right!? Alright, let's go with that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CA)
【Mayuri】Yup, okay-. Well then, before we change the past, I gotta eat all this ramen first-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DA)
Then Mayuri starts eating the ramen for dear life.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F4)
【Kurisu】What's wrong with not eating it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001304)
【Mayuri】That'll be a waste♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001318)
【Kurisu】Ah, I, I see.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001332)
 That's right... ahaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001346)
Mayuri answers while smiling. Kurisu's face goes stiff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000135E)
She really is a <DICT>dumb girl</DICT>. This isn't the first time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
The D-mail preparations are set.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
The contents of Mayuri's mail are simple enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001496)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>
%LC"Cup oden is:"<LINE>
"Piping hot &"<LINE>
"Delicious!!!"
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C6)
Now we just pray that Mayuri will be inclined to choose cup oden.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001522)
We wait for Mayuri to finish eating her cup ramen and activate the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001532)
To send it one hour back, we set the timer to 1#. In other words, we set the microwave for only one second.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001542)
I wonder if the discharge phenomenon will occur in that small time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001552)
This is another first challenge for this experiment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001562)
【Rintaro】Microwave Ophone (Temp), activate!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001638)
【Mayuri】Aah, the mail still hasn't sent-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001648)
There wasn't enough time to blink, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175E)
【Kurisu】So the discharge phenomenon won't occur with just one second, huh. It might just be data, but that's still good to know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176E)
【Itaru】What if you try warming it up beforehand?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001788)
【Kurisu】Warming it up?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001798)
【Itaru】Basically, the discharge phenomenon won't occur with one second, right? Then just operate the microwave beforehand for about 30 seconds without sending a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A8)
【Itaru】Wait a while after that, and try it again with the timer set at one second. If you do that, won't the discharge phenomenon occur even with just one second?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B8)
【Kurisu】Any Basis?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D2)
【Itaru】Zilch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A8)
【Rintaro】Uhh, Mayuri, got anything else!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C6)
【Mayuri】Eh, well...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E0)
 Then, how about changing the garnish in the onigiri I bought last night-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F4)
【Rintaro】You remember what garnish you had in the onigiri you ate last night?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001904)
【Mayuri】Okaka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019CE)
【Kurisu】A-an immediate response!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DE)
Seems she remembers it clearly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F2)
【Mayuri】So then, change the okaka to, um...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A0C)
 Let's go with mentaiko-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A20)
...Maybe I should search for another test subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A30)
In the end, the four lab mems sit silently, obviously making me think we can't complete a single experiment.
