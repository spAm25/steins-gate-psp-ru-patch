#WRITE(PTR, $000007D8)
Not many people are left at ComiMa at this hour, even though it's opening day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E8)
Of course, the corporate booths and the cosplay grounds are still thriving, but there aren't as many people as there were lined up for admission.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F8)
I've been calling Mayuri and sending her texts since before, but she hasn't responded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000808)
I asked Daru over the phone too, but he said he hasn't seen her today either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000818)
Cosplay ends at 4PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000828)
I focused on searching the cosplay grounds during that time, but I couldn't find her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C8)
Maybe she finished early and went home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D8)
I try calling Mayuri's home phone with that thought in mind. But she apparently hasn't gone home yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E8)
Just where is she...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F8)
--It feels like she'll disappear if I take my eyes off of her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6C)
Mayuri had some sort of helpless face since before she lost her grandmother.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7C)
...That's how I felt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8C)
Although that may not have been the case.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9C)
That might have just been what I thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAC)
Because we've been thoughtlessly together. Because she's been close for a long time--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABC)
Because I saw her when she was that weak--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACC)
I might have just been overprotective of her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADC)
But I don't care how other people see us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEC)
Anyway, it's my nature to not leave Mayuri alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1E)
I show up at that graveyard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2E)
The final resting place of Mayuri's beloved Granny.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3E)
How long has it been since I've been here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4E)
Ever since Mayuri became my hostage, I've tagged along with her periodically, so I'd come here about once a year.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5E)
But I haven't come here once since entering high school, so it's been about three or four years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6E)
When I get close to the grave, a voice reaches my ears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7E)
It's Mayuri's voice without a doubt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8E)
It sounds like she's talking with someone, but--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9E)
I approach without calling out to her, and peek in on her condition from some distance away--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D96)
【Mayuri】Hey, Granny.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA6)
Mayuri is talking to the grave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB6)
I'm relieved to find her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC6)
I'm glad she didn't disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD6)
【Mayuri】Lately, I've been having some scary dreams-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE6)
I thought she had finally mastered the ability to talk to ghosts, but it looks more like she's just talking to herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF6)
【Mayuri】And in those dreams, Mayushii always gets hurt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
【Mayuri】I get shot with a pistol's bang, or get involved in car accidents, or get run over by a train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E22)
Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E32)
Could that mean...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E42)
【Mayuri】They seem so real, it's really painful, and really sad. I try to shout "Someone save me" for dear life, but I can't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E52)
【Mayuri】Why could I be having those dreams?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E62)
Could that mean that she has memories of all her deaths... from previous world lines?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E72)
Her memories continue, just like with my Reading Steiner?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E82)
【Mayuri】And you know, those dreams always end the same way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E92)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's crying, and Okarin comes to save me-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA2)
【Mayuri】Mayushii always says "thank you, thank you, " to Okarin, but Okarin can't hear her voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB2)
【Mayuri】Okarin embraces Mayushii, and makes a very sad face. Like he's about to cry, but absolutely doesn't cry, you know? But I know he's trying his best to hold himself back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC2)
...In retrospect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE4)
Both Faris and Lukako remembered their memories before the past was changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF4)
I thought memories couldn't be shared between world lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001004)
I thought my Reading Steiner was special.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001070)
But maybe that isn't true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001080)
Maybe everybody has the same power as me, but to varying degrees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001090)
It might even be to the point where it can't be called a power.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A0)
【Mayuri】So Mayushii also gets sad, and says "Sorry, sorry", but her voice doesn't reach him after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B0)
【Mayuri】And then I always wake up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C0)
【Mayuri】Why could I be having these dreams...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AC)
I've never been able to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001298)
Right in front of my eyes, Mayuri has time, and time again, lost her life.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001308)
I kept time leaping to try and prevent that, but were Mayuri's memories tormenting her as dreams in other world lines?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001318)
Without calling out to Mayuri, I stay hidden, biting my lip tightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001328)
Now, I've lost my way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001338)
Should I save Mayuri? Should I save Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001348)
There's no convenient option where I can save both.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001358)
One or the other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001368)
If I choose Kurisu, then Mayuri's dreams will become a reality...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001378)
I don't want to give Mayuri a painful time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001388)
Until now, I've only ever thought about saving Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001398)
But even so, it's not like I can just let Kurisu die...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A8)
I'm lost at another dead end without an answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B8)
Without noticing me, Mayuri looks up to the sky, just like the time before she became a hostage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C8)
She keeps talking to her Granny in heaven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D8)
【Mayuri】Ah, that's right, you know, lately our lab mem count has increased-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E8)
【Mayuri】There's Chris-chan, Moeka-san, Luka-kun, and Faris-chan. Also, she's moved away, but there's also Suzu-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F8)
【Mayuri】Eight people. Amazing, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001408)
All of them became lab mems in this world line, but there's still one person who has yet to send a D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001418)
【Mayuri】Even though at first, it was just Okarin and Mayushii.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001428)
【Mayuri】When the lab was just formed, Okarin really wasn't that interesting, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001438)
【Mayuri】But lately, he looks like he's having lots of fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001448)
Is that how she saw it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001458)
But that's not necessarily wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001468)
Just as I thought, she really observes me well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001478)
【Mayuri】When I see Okarin like that, Mayushii also gets happy and smiley.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001488)
【Mayuri】Also, it gets busy and exciting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001498)
【Mayuri】Especially Chris-chan, you see. She got her thesis published in a famous American book. She's really smart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A8)
【Mayuri】Mayushii admires her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B8)
【Mayuri】She even made a time machine-. Ah, she made it together with Okarin and Daru-kun too, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C8)
And then Mayuri becomes silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001568)
Her eyes become distant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001578)
She looks at the sky, standing still.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001588)
What could she be thinking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001598)
【Mayuri】But you know, sometimes I think-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A8)
【Mayuri】In the beginning, Mayushii was intruding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
【Mayuri】When the lab was just the two of us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
【Mayuri】When school ends and I come to the lab, Okarin isn't there. And so, I tidy up the room, and decorate it with small cute things, and finally Okarin comes back a bit late.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
【Mayuri】Mayushii says "welcome home-", and Okarin proudly answers "good work" without saying "I'm back".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E8)
【Mayuri】After that, every day, for about two hours, the two of us would spend our time idly, and then go home together on the train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F8)
【Mayuri】Those two hours, we mostly don't talk, but it's not an unpleasant silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001608)
【Mayuri】Just a feeling that we're next to each other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001618)
【Mayuri】We sit next to each other on the sofa. Okarin writes some things like the lab's strategy protocol, and Mayushii reads manga, or plays games.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001628)
【Mayuri】I remember every now and then, we'd eat sweets together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001638)
【Mayuri】Time would flow very slowly and gently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001648)
【Mayuri】But I still thought that was okay too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001658)
【Mayuri】Mayushii would feel like she's really become a hostage, and would laugh "ehhehe-" alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001668)
【Mayuri】When Okarin would see Mayuri smiling, he said this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001678)
Mayuri's words touch me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001688)
I remember that time too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001736)
About four months ago. Back when it was still spring.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001746)
Instead of the livelihood our lab now has, it had a leisurely time isolated from the outside world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001756)
【Rintaro】Did something good happen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001766)
【Mayuri】Yup. Well, something good didn't happen, but it happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001776)
【Rintaro】I see, you saw an illusion, huh. Perhaps that was an attack from one "Organization" leader, known as the Illusion Conductor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001790)
【Mayuri】I see-. Well, gotta be careful then. But I'm sure that Illusion Kidhugger is a--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A0)
【Rintaro】Not Kidhugger. Conductor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BA)
【Mayuri】I'm sure he's not a bad guy-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001808)
That was really an inconsequential conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001818)
【Mayuri】That was really pleasant for Mayushii.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001828)
【Mayuri】So happy that I could cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001838)
【Mayuri】I wanted to stay like that forever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001848)
【Mayuri】Ah, but it's not like I hate the livelihood now, okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001858)
Mayuri explains to her Granny in heaven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001900)
Then Mayuri stops looking to the sky, and hangs her head down instead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001910)
【Mayuri】Lately I've had a little less time to talk with Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001920)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001930)
【Mayuri】So, Mayushii might be getting a little lonely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001940)
The reason we've had less time to talk is because I've been keeping Mayuri's dreams from becoming reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001950)
Frantically evading that result.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019B2)
Because I want Mayuri to always be smiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C2)
Because I don't want her to make the same sad face as when her Granny died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019E2)
【Mayuri】But you know, I don't want to be a burden for Okarin-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F2)
Burden...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A02)
Mayuri used that word again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A12)
Even I don't feel that way one bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A22)
【Mayuri】Mayuri's always, always nothing but a nuisance to Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A32)
【Mayuri】Hey, Granny.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A42)
Mayuri raises her head again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A52)
【Mayuri】...I can't stay like this forever, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A62)
【Rintaro】You can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A72)
【Mayuri】Hmm-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
I call out to her when I've had enough, and Mayuri looks back at me blankly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B22)
And on that face where innocence still remains.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B32)
Slowly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B42)
A smile spreads.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B52)
【Mayuri】It's Okarin-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B62)
【Mayuri】Wow, how did you know I was here-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B72)
【Rintaro】I always know where my hostage is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B82)
【Mayuri】Hostage...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B92)
【Rintaro】So you can't escape my grasp. Ever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA2)
【Mayuri】I see-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB2)
【Mayuri】But you shouldn't overdo it, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC2)
【Mayuri】You know, Mayushii's just a little worried.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD2)
【Rintaro】...This Hououin Kyouma is not weak enough for you to worry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE2)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, when the time comes to tell you, I'll tell you everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF2)
【Mayuri】...Howha?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C02)
【Rintaro】So until then, act like nothing's changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C12)
【Mayuri】...okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C22)
Mayuri stand up and looks at the grave once more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C32)
She gives a brand new white lily and a dango as an offering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C42)
【Mayuri】Okarin. Let's go back?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C52)
【Rintaro】Before we go back, we'll eat some dango, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C62)
Coming for worship and eating dango from from a nearby stand on the way back was a daily routine back then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C72)
【Mayuri】Ehhehe-. Of course~♪
