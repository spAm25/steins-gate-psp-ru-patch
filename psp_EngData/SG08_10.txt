The next day. Mayuri and Daru left for Ariake early in the morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E0)
I'm going to meet Lukako just like yesterday, tell her "Let's go meet with Mayuri", and take a train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F0)
Today won't be a date with just the two of us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000800)
Because we don't have time, and I feel like I've already hurt her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000810)
And so the strategy I took was--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000948)
When we leave the Kokusai-Tenjijo Station, Lukako stares in wonder at the scene spreading throughout her sight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000958)
People, people, people...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000968)
People cover the land as far as the eye can see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000978)
ComiMa, the otaku festival.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000988)
Since it's the first day, Big Sight is more crowded than usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000998)
Correct, my strategy was to take Lukako out to ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A8)
Of course, I didn't make her cosplay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B8)
Lukako said it was embarrassing, and she wouldn't listen to Mayuri's persistent pestering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C8)
I don't want to make Lukako do something she doesn't like either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D8)
So, we just came to look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E8)
Besides, if we join up with the ecstatic Mayuri and Daru on the grounds, then they can keep talking about this and that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F8)
The conversation won't get paused like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A08)
"Rely on companions".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A18)
What wonderful words!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A28)
A ComiMa date. In some sense, I might have to bear the killing intent of the otaku heroes, but I don't really care what other people think of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A38)
And with that said, I head to the meeting place we decided beforehand, weaving through the crowd of people. Lukako also seems frantic fighting the mental battle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A80)
【Mayuri】Tutturu-♪ Okari-n. Luka-cha-n
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A90)
I see the petite Mayuri waving her hands widely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA0)
Mayuri meets up with us at the edge of the parking lot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB0)
There aren't as many people there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B58)
【Mayuri】Welcome to ComiMa, Luka-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B68)
【Luka】Y-yeah. It's my first time coming here, but it's amazing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B78)
【Mayuri】Take it easy!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B88)
【Rintaro】Where's Daru?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B98)
【Mayuri】Well, Daru-kun's lined up to get promo goods, so he doesn't want to get out of line-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA8)
【Mayuri】He said maybe he'll join us after he gets some spoils of war-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB8)
So he won't join up with us until about an hour later, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC8)
Oh damn him, prioritizing himself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD8)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE8)
Lukako seemed nothing but overwhelmed, anxiously looking around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF8)
There really still is awkwardness between Lukako and me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C08)
Maybe she's not be over what happened yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C18)
After all, even during the train ride, we haven't had any conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C28)
I just don't understand why we became lovers if it's come to this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C38)
It seems like Lukako and I talked more naturally and had more fun when we weren't lovers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C48)
Was it a mistake to bring her to ComiMa?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C58)
But Lukako didn't refuse. Even when I told her we were going to ComiMa, she just obediently nodded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C68)
【Mayuri】Mayushii will guide you through the grounds today-. Well, there are a lot of people, so we have to try not to be a bother.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C78)
【Mayuri】Let's go to the cosplay grounds first-, and then I guess we'll go inside-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C88)
Mayuri really is more ecstatic than usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C98)
She's clearly in good cheer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA8)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, is there anything you guys want to see-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB8)
【Rintaro】...Lukako, is there anything you want to see?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC8)
【Luka】Ah, no...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD8)
Lukako shakes her head left and right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE8)
【Luka】I don't really know, so... if Okabe-san wants to see something, I'll go see it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF8)
【Rintaro】It's not like I'm really interested or anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D08)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D18)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D28)
Lukako's expression was unclear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D38)
Crap, I shouldn't have answered like that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D48)
【Mayuri】Heyhey, Luka-chan. If you come to the cosplay grounds, you'll definitely change your mind about cosplaying-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D58)
Mayuri talks happily to Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D68)
Relying on this optimistic girl who can't read the atmosphere was the right choice after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D78)
【Mayuri】It's not embarrassing at all, see? 'Cause everyone's having fun-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D88)
【Mayuri】I've told you about the cosplayers who wear Mayushii's costumes, Kaede-chan and Fubuki-chan, but I'll introduce you to them now-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D98)
【Mayuri】So, if you can, I want you to come tomorrow too-. Because then, I'd prepare costumes for Okarin and Luka-chan, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED8)
【Mayuri】I think Okarin would look perfect as the protagonist in "<DICT>Code Jeass</DICT>", %B2SZerosum<%B2E-sama-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE8)
【Mayuri】If Okarin does it too, Luka-chan can cosplay at ease, can't she-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF8)
【Mayuri】What do you think-? Mayushii thinks it's a good idea-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
【Rintaro】Rejected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F18)
【Luka】S-sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001090)
【Mayuri】Ehh-. No way...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A0)
When Lukako and I refuse, Mayuri drops both her shoulders in disappointment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C4)
In the end, we got fed up with the amount of people, so Lukako and I left Ariake early.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D4)
We took the direct shuttle bus to Akiba that only runs during ComiMa, but it was so cramped inside, I thought I was gonna die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001228)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001238)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001248)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001258)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
When we return to Akiba, Lukako and I are so tired we can't even move our mouths. My feet are so heavy I thought they turned to lead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001278)
I can't even hear the traffic's noise, the cicada's cries, or the sounds of cars and bikes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001288)
The two of us return to the shrine with shut mouthes like Spanish monks under vows of silence,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
Lukako doesn't raise one complaint.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F4)
But it was obvious that taking her to ComiMa was a mistake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000144A)
Lukako's expression has been stiff ever since Mayuri showed us around the grounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145A)
Maybe she's still traumatized by otaku.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001508)
I remember the first time I met Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001518)
At that time, he was in a fight with otaku.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001528)
So maybe they didn't leave a good impression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158C)
We don't talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159C)
For a long time, we weren't alone, but packed like sardines. I can probably count the words I said directly to Lukako today on my fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AC)
When we arrive at the shrine, our time as lovers will end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BC)
So this is our last chance to talk like lovers do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CC)
But I'm confused.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DC)
Just what should I talk about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EC)
I tried looking for a topic we had in common.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FC)
About the demon sword, "Samidare".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160C)
About the "Seishin Zanma" style's swordmanship.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161C)
But those pretentious hipster bullshit topics are prohibited, acording to Kurisu and the manual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162C)
So something else--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163C)
And then I realized.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164C)
That's all Lukako and I have in common.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179E)
Silence seeps through the shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AE)
When we get here, I seem calm, but am not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BE)
I safely escorted Lukako home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CE)
Today is the day Mayuri is killed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017DE)
The time limit is within three hours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EE)
So--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FE)
The temporary relationship between Lukako and me ends here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180E)
Then I just need to Lukako to give me her mother's pager number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181E)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182E)
Is it really okay to let it end like this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183E)
In the end, what have I done for Lukako?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000184E)
I haven't done squat, have I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185E)
Rather, haven't I done nothing but hurt her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001878)
【Luka】Ugh... hic...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
I got startled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001898)
Lukako sobs convulsively, cupping both hands over her mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A8)
Tears overflow from her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B8)
【Rintaro】Lukako...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C8)
When I try coming closer out of concern, Lukako draws back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D8)
【Luka】Uugh... ugg... sniff...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E8)
Lukako wipes the corners of her eyes, but the tears keep flowing, forming a glistening line down each cheek.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F8)
I was pushed into endless chaos.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001908)
A girl is crying before my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001918)
Even though I, as a man, can't leave that alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001928)
I stand stock still, saying not a single word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001938)
The source of Lukako's tears is undoubtedly me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001948)
Even though it was only temporary, I still didn't treat her right as a girlfriend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001958)
And this is how it ends.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001968)
It ends without either of us saying a word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001978)
Lukako--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001988)
She--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001998)
Was hurt, and started to cry, because of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A8)
And yet, Lukako--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C2)
【Luka】Th...ank you... very much...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D2)
Said that and bowed her head to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019E2)
【Rintaro】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F2)
On her face wet with tears were signs of lovely shyness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A02)
【Luka】You being... my lover... sniff...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A12)
【Luka】Made me... really... happy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A22)
That's a lie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3C)
【Luka】I'm... glad... I fell in love... with Okabe-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A4C)
Isn't that a lie?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5C)
Lukako gently holds my hand to my surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A6C)
A very warm hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7C)
A very thin hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A8C)
Touching Lukako's hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A9C)
Touching Lukako's body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AAC)
The first time since we became lovers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ABC)
And also, the last time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACC)
Lukako places a memo pad in my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADC)
And then our hands part.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEC)
She bows her head again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B06)
【Luka】...Bye now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B22)
Lukako turns her back to me, gradually walking towards the shrine office.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B32)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B42)
I look at the memo pad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B52)
A number was written there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B62)
That's probably Lukako's mother's pager number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B72)
She kept her promise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B82)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B92)
But, I can't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA2)
I can't let it end like this--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CCE)
I dash back to the lab with all my strength, disregard Kurisu, who was watching over, and decisively time leap--
<END>
