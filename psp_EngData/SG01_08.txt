【Rintaro】...Damn, it's hot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000028C)
When I returned to Akiba after going to the university in the morning, I was engulfed by an unbearable heat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000029C)
So for now, I decided to stay at a certain bakery in Yodobashi and appease my thirst with an iced coffee.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002AC)
I'll take this opportunity to check out @channel on my cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002BC)
This is a regular activity for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002CC)
I frequent the occult and future technology boards, and occasionally visit the physics board.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002DC)
There are some others that I go to, but not periodically.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F0)
I checked if @channel has any threads about either the mass disappearance phenomenon or the Makise Kurisu stabbing incident, but didn't find any.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000300)
So, what I saw was actually a delusion...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000310)
Some of the threads in the occult section have a person who calls himself "John Titor" posting in them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000320)
John Titor? After such a long time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000330)
I actually know quite a lot about this guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DA)
He's a self-proclaimed time traveler who first appeared on American forums about 10 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F4)
Titor posted that he came from the year 2036 to get an old PC called "<DICT>IBN</DICT>5100", while answering the questions of the forum %B2Sdwellers%B2E.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000404)
He partially "predicted" certain future events, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041C)
Examples of which are the outbreak of the Iraq war and the spread of the <DICT>Creutzfeld-Jakob disease</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000042C)
He tried to prove that he's a from the future by explaining the theory behind his time machine and taking pictures of it's instruction manual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000043C)
However, he disappeared after about 4 months without revealing his true identity to the public.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000044C)
At one point, his predictions that turned out to be true became a hot subject in Japan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000045C)
Yes, there were things that he got right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046C)
However, due to the many false predictions and contradictions in his posts, the majority of people are skeptical about him being a time traveler.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047C)
And so, you're telling me that, after 10 years, John Titor appeared in Japan's @channel?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E8)
How stupid... What an obvious <DICT>troll</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004F8)
In the first place, John Titor is an American, so why the hell is he posting on @channel in perfect Japanese?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000508)
Well, I guess I'll check out what he says...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000738)
Looks like he's a making a website.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000748)
Wait, I'm quite sure that he already had one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075E)
What this Titor is writing closely resembles the posts that the original Titor made 10 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076E)
Some of the books based on him are translated into Japanese and are being sold here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077E)
I got my hands on one of them by accident, and got somewhat interested.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000078E)
That's why I know that what he's posting here on @channel is pretty much the same as what the one from 10 years ago posted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000079E)
I wonder where I put that book...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007AE)
I read it when I was in middle school, so it's probably in some shelf back at my parent's home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007BE)
Regardless of that, this new John Titor is nothing but an impostor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007CE)
No, the way he's pretty much copying and pasting everything makes him something below that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007DE)
There are a lot of enthusiasts on @channel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EE)
It's true that John Titor is not that popular here in Japan, but I'm quite sure that these people won't fall for such a troll.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089E)
However, the reactions of the posters are quite the opposite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AE)
It feels as if no one is aware of the first time that John Titor appeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BE)
No one is even talking about his appearance from 10 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008CE)
I tried to post about it, but was completely ignored.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DE)
Damn it...! What the hell...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000942)
I need to do some investigation on this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000952)
There's an American website about John Titor...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000962)
And tons of personal blogs where people talk about him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000972)
I try looking up "John Titor" on a search engine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2C)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>
%LCSearch Results: 12 hits
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A64)
Only 12?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A74)
Moreover, all 12 of the results are the posts that the current Titor is posting in @chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A84)
I can't find a single trace of the Titor from 10 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A94)
It's too weird. This definitely can't be real...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA4)
A few years ago I made a search about him, and there were thousands of hits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB4)
Does this site use a filter or something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1E)
I test this out with another search engine, but the results were the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5C)
This is truly getting to me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6C)
I feel as if I'm the only one who wandered into some other world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7C)
Is this a conspiracy of the Organization?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8C)
This situation is making me feel somewhat eerie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9C)
Ever since yesterday, lots of confusing events have been happening.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0E)
I'll try calling Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2C)
He will definitely know about Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4A)
That is something I'm certain about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C68)
I actually talked with him about John Titor some time ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C86)
Though, I forgot the details of the conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA4)
However, I'm completely sure that the conversation happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E98)
【Itaru】Yeah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB4)
【Rintaro】It's me, what's your situation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED0)
【Itaru】...Okarin, can't you at least stop that stuff when talking on the phone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEC)
【Rintaro】I'm asking you about what you know concerning John Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
【Itaru】I'm not really getting you, bro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F24)
【Rintaro】At any rate, where are you now? Are you coming to the lab?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F40)
【Itaru】Right now I'm at "MayQueen+Nyan⑯".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5C)
【Rintaro】Again...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F74)
"MayQueen+Nyan⑯" is <DICT>Maid Cafe</DICT> in Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F84)
Daru, who likes 3D maids, is a regular over there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F94)
【Rintaro】I need to have a confidential conversation with you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA4)
Though, I don't think that the confidentiality will be necessary...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB4)
【Rintaro】Don't leave until I come there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD0)
【Itaru】Huh? You're coming? Sweet!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001144)
Taking out my phone from the bag is such a pain, so I decided not to call Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001154)
However, on my way back to the lab, I sent him an email and got his location from the response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001194)
By "MayQueen", he's referring to "MayQueen+Nyan⑯", a <DICT>Maid Cafe</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A4)
Daru, who likes 3D maids, is a regular over there.
