When we get to the front of the lab, the day's already dark.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000204)
Normally it takes less than 15 minutes, but since Kurisu kept complaining to take breaks, it ended up taking more than twice that time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000024C)
【Kurisu】Haah, we finally made it... I'm tired-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000025C)
【Rintaro】If you didn't complain so much about everything, we would've gotten here sooner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000276)
【Kurisu】Right back at you. You said "let's take a break" five times along the way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000286)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000296)
【Rintaro】That's because I wasn't feeling well....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B0)
【Kurisu】Is something wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C0)
【Rintaro】Yeah... occasionally, my right arm aches... And when it does, dark destructive impulses overcome my heart--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002DA)
【Kurisu】Shaddup, be quiet, or I'll extract your right arm's peripheral nerves out by the roots.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002EA)
Heeeeee. What a bizarre train of thought!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000302)
Extracting peripheral nerves would be like last year's <DICT>New Gene Incidents</DICT>, wouldn't it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000312)
With that said, I shut up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032E)
The final barrier to bringing the IBN 5100 into the lab awaits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000039C)
We have to ascend this rickety building's narrow staircase.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003AC)
【Kurisu】Shouldn't you call people to help?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BC)
【Rintaro】Th-that's true....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000414)
Looking up from outside, the lab's lights are turned on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E8)
【Suzuha】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004F8)
Working Warrior appears from the Braun Tube Workshop with perfect timing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000508)
【Suzuha】If it isn't Okabe Rintaro. What are you carrying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000518)
【Rintaro】Hmph, you want to know? Then I'll tell you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000560)
【Kurisu】Wait, if you're just going to stand and talk, shouldn't we put the box down first?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000570)
【Rintaro】Ah, ahh, no, we don't really need to stand and talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C0)
【Suzuha】So, what is that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D0)
【Rintaro】If I said it was the IBN 5100... what would you do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005EA)
【Suzuha】No way!? Amazing! So you got one! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005FA)
I wish she'd stop calling me by my full name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000060A)
If you're going to do that, then at least use Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000624)
【Suzuha】Where? Where was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000634)
【Kurisu】Ugh, it's heavy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000644)
Kurisu starts giving in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000654)
Well, I'm about at my limit too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000664)
【Rintaro】Let's put it down for now!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000688)
Kurisu and I place it on the ground gently, so as to not damage the contents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D0)
【Kurisu】Haah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000718)
【Suzuha】So, where was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000728)
【Rintaro】Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000742)
【Suzuha】Yanbayashishrine? By shrine, you mean like a Shinto god's shrine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000752)
【Rintaro】Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000762)
【Suzuha】Why was it over there...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000772)
Then, suddenly, Suzuha looks towards Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000792)
【Suzuha】Ah...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A2)
She gasps, and then approaches close enough to Kurisu she could feel her breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B8)
【Kurisu】W-what is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C8)
【Suzuha】Makise Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D8)
【Kurisu】Yes, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F2)
【Suzuha】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000902)
For some reason, she stares at Kurisu with a frightful force.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091C)
Kurisu squints as if to oppose it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092C)
Wh-what's with this tension....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093C)
I really can't force myself into this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000956)
【Kurisu】What is it? Did I do something to you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C4)
【Suzuha】...Hmph.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D4)
Suzuha turns away, and without looking back to us, draws back into the Braun Tube Workshop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1C)
【Kurisu】Who was that just now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2C)
Kurisu turns her remaining anger at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3C)
【Rintaro】The part-timer at the first floor's Braun Tube Workshop...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A56)
【Kurisu】Why was she glaring at me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A66)
【Rintaro】I-I dunno. Did you do something to make her angry?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A80)
【Kurisu】That's the first time I ever met her. How rude of her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A90)
I thought about reminding Kurisu that she suddenly glared at me at our first meeting, but that was an illusion, so I didn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC0)
I get Daru and Mayuri out of the lab to help us, and the four of us carry the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
【Rintaro】Good work, everyone. With this, we can fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C18)
【Kurisu】Who are you fighting?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C28)
【Rintaro】SERN, and the ruling structures that control the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C38)
【Kurisu】You really seem happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C48)
【Rintaro】Happy? I never asked for this. Who do you think I am? I'm an insane mad scientist, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C58)
【Rintaro】What I want to obtain is chaos. The time machine for that purpose. Fuuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7A)
【Kurisu】I'm sorry, say that again. You really are a junkie, hypersecreting <DICT>β endorphins</DICT>, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC2)
【Mayuri】Okarin, Okarin, I always say it's bad to do bad things, don't I-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0A)
【Itaru】But, wow. You seriously found one. You can calmly do what none of us can. Fucking miracles--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D24)
【Kurisu】How do they work?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3E)
【Itaru】...Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4E)
【Rintaro】Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D68)
【Kurisu】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D78)
For a moment, the four of us are silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D92)
【Mayuri】He was able to find it because of Mayushii's help-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB0)
Not reading the atmosphere, Mayuri puffs her chest out in pride.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC0)
I don't overlook Kurisu's gasp of surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDA)
【Mayuri】Without Mayushii's info-, Okarin would still be lost and confused on the streets of Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEA)
【Rintaro】Yeah, it's just as Mayuri said. She did well this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E04)
【Mayuri】Ehhehe-. With that said-, Mayushii has to go home soon-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E14)
【Mayuri】What about you, Chris-chan-? Wanna come with me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2E)
【Kurisu】Thanks, But I'm staying her a while longer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3E)
Looks like Kurisu's interested in the IBN 5100 and SERN after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4E)
Which reminds me, I haven't told her the details yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E68)
【Mayuri】I see-. But you should go home soon so you won't be late, you know-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E82)
【Mayuri】Well then, see you tomorrow-. Tutturu-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9E)
Mayuri waves her hand as she leaves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EAE)
【Rintaro】Now then, Daru. When do you think we can use the IBN 5100 to hack SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC8)
【Itaru】Hmm-, well-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE4)
Daru talks while plugging the IBN 5100's power adapter into the wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF4)
The power supply makes a noisy sound when it's turned on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3C)
【Itaru】Wow-, it turned on properly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F56)
【Itaru】First, I need to learn how to use this thing, right? In the first place, it looks like hooking it up is going to be a pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F66)
【Itaru】It might take some time. It's impossible to do it at the same time as I search for the server's root ID.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F76)
【Rintaro】Doesn't matter. Prioritize the ID search.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F86)
【Rintaro】If possible, I'd like you to get the IBN 5100 ready to use this month, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA0)
【Itaru】There's still 30 days left this month. It really won't take until next month.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB0)
That's actually reassuring. As expected of the supah hakah.
<FILEEND1E>
