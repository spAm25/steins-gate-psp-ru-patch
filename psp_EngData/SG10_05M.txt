#WRITE(PTR, $00000214)
【Rintaro】...I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000224)
I tell her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000024A)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000025A)
I turn to the girl whom I will now let die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000026A)
【Rintaro】Mayuri is the one person I want to save no matter what.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000027A)
Almost wringing myself out, I tell her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000028A)
【Rintaro】...I can't save you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000029A)
【Kurisu】...it's okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002AA)
When I finish telling her, I feel like the weight of a tombstone disappeared from my shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002BA)
At the same time, I also started to feel the pain of several rods impaling my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002CA)
Kurisu weakly returns my embrace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002DA)
Then she separates from me, and stands up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032A)
【Kurisu】Well then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033A)
Her face already showed she was refreshed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000034A)
【Kurisu】I'll go home first.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000035A)
【Rintaro】Back home? Where to...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000036A)
Don't tell me she means America?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000384)
【Kurisu】The lab, of course. I need to dry my clothes. I also want to shower.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000394)
In that case, we should go back together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A4)
I was about to say that, but Kurisu beat me to the punch as if she could read my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BE)
【Kurisu】You, stay and wait here a while, while you're all wet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CE)
【Kurisu】Understand?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DE)
We won't go back together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EE)
That's her verdict.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FE)
【Rintaro】...understood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046C)
I hang my head. And close my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047C)
I hug my own arms.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000048C)
Kurisu's footsteps fade into the distance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000049C)
Even though it's summer...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004AC)
And even though this building's air conditioning isn't working...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BC)
My whole body is shivering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CC)
Because I can no longer show my face to Kurisu...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DC)
I was relieved that she rejected going home together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EC)
【Rintaro】He... hehe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FC)
I unconsciously started laughing in self-derision.
