Chapter 7 【Made in Complex】

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BC)
The world cracks into a geometric figure, then stretches and squashes like rubber.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CC)
That sequence repeated over and over in a short span.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DC)
I feel light condense between my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EC)
Countless stars fall underneath my eyelids.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FC)
Those stars eventually call color back to the monochrome world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000050C)
【Rintaro】--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000051C)
The severe vertigo passes in several seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000052C)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000548)
Cold sweat oozes from my temples.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000558)
While I hit both sides of my head with my fists, the air in my lungs squeezes out little by little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000568)
The world line has changed, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000578)
I head to the lounge to check with the Divergence Meter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000618)
【Rintaro】It disappeared...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000628)
Before the world line changed-- just a few minutes ago-- I had checked that Nixie tube meter, but now it's nowhere to be found.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000638)
I soon understand what's going on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000648)
The day I received that meter was within the time undone by that last D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000658)
So it's natural that the meter isn't here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000668)
I feel a throbbing pain deep within my chest. Feelings of regret.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000678)
I grind my teeth and fight that pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000688)
If nobody else will remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000698)
Then I guess only I protect those memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A8)
Our memories with Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B8)
Inside the room are Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C8)
Mayuri and Kurisu are getting along on the sofa, dozing off shoulder to shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D8)
Daru doesn't look towards that spectacle of two innocent high school girls, but instead plays eroge on his PC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E8)
I take a deep breath and turn on the TV.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F8)
I tuned to a news channel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000708)
The world line should've changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000718)
I erased our memories of Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000728)
And because of that, Suzuha should have leapt to 1975 without losing her memories, bringing the IBN 5100 to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000738)
Then we should use that to hack into SERN and completely erase all of the information they intercepted from us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000748)
If we do that, then Moeka's group won't attack, and Mayuri won't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000758)
That's how it should've happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000768)
That's how it has to be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000778)
That's how I believed it would be, which is why I sacrificed Suzuha's memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000788)
The quickest way to confirm that change is to see whether or not there are delays at Akihabara Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000798)
【Rintaro】Daru, is the Yamate Line stopped?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E0)
【Itaru】Huh? No, it's not stopped, is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F0)
【Rintaro】Check online.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000800)
【Itaru】Wait, I'm at a great part.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000810)
【Rintaro】Please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000820)
Daru sighs as he looks at the top page of Taboo!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000083A)
【Itaru】Mm, it doesn't look stopped after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084A)
【Rintaro】Thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085A)
The world line... changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086A)
Then that retro PC-- the IBN 5100, should be in the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090A)
I go back to the development room and see if I can find anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091A)
But contrary to my expectations, I couldn't find it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092A)
What does this mean...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093A)
I look at my watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000094A)
7:43PM
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000095A)
Moeka's group attacks--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000096A)
What time again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000097A)
My heart throbs like a drum.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098A)
Everything should've been solved. Moeka's group isn't going into action, as evidenced by the normal train schedule. I was convinced of that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099A)
So, why? It doesn't feel like anything's been solved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AA)
The disappearance of the IBN 5100 really does put me at unease.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BA)
I want to slowly think about where that retro PC could be, but I don't think I have that much free time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009CA)
My feelings press me on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009DA)
I'm cornered and can't judge things properly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009EA)
Looking like an idiot, I check my watch again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009FA)
7:46PM
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0A)
The scene back then comes back to mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1A)
Mayuri, who died bleeding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
The smell of gunpowder from Moeka's gun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3A)
I frantically shake those visions out of my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
I look at the lab entrance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5A)
...The door hasn't been kicked open yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6A)
I gulp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7A)
With feelings like prayer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8A)
I was petrified.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBA)
...Time passed to 9PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCA)
I peek out of the window down the street.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDA)
Nobody's there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEA)
【Itaru】Okarin, are you waiting for someone? You've been looking down there for a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFA)
Just like Daru said, I had probably peeked down 20 times in the past hour.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
And each of those 20 times, I didn't detect any suspicious figures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1A)
...Moeka's group didn't appear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2A)
If my memories aren't mistaken, the attack was earlier than 8PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3A)
Just as I thought, the past changed along with the world line. So I should think that the event of the attack has also changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4A)
Suzuha's sacrifice was not in vain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5A)
Finally aware of that fact, I let out a deep breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6A)
Now I notice that my hour of heightened tension caused my armpits to sweat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7A)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, and Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D82)
The Lab Mem Girls that had been dozing off a while ago were now awake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D92)
They're having a slightly late dinner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA2)
Mayuri has cup yakisoba. Kurisu has cup tonkotsu ramen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB2)
By the way, Kurisu's slurping the noodles with a fork.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCC)
【Kurisu】...? Eh, right now, did you just say my name normally?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDC)
Kurisu lifts up her face, stunned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEC)
She seems really astonished.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFC)
【Rintaro】When you two are done eating, go home. It's already this late, so I'll send you off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E16)
【Mayuri】Okidokey, I'll do that-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E30)
【Kurisu】It's not like I need Okabe to send me off or anything. I can go home alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E40)
【Rintaro】Just listen. Daru, you too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E50)
【Itaru】Huh? Me too?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8C)
The Yamate, Sobu, and Keihin-Tohoku lines, as well as the Ginza Line that passes through Suehirocho Station, are all operating normally without a problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9C)
Neither Moeka, nor her fellow men, could be seen anywhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
Kurisu's taking the Sobu Line to the next station, Ochanomizu, while Daru's going the opposite way to Shin-Koiwa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBC)
Mayuri and I are taking the Yamate Line to Ikebukuro, so we part at the station's ticket gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCC)
And now, the Lamate Line safely heads through the dark night to Ikebukuro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
There are surprisingly few passengers. I guess there aren't many homebound salarymen since they're off for Obon holiday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001024)
Mayuri was silently playing a handheld game. A RaiNet Kakeru action RPG. Inside the small LCD fights Mayuri's playable character, a gigantic Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001034)
I stand next to her, deep in emotion, gazing at the profile of my childhood friend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001044)
Mayuri survived the night of the 13th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001060)
Now that I think about it, just how many times have I tasted the despair of tonight?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001070)
No matter what I did, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't save this optimistic childhood friend of mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001080)
Right before my eyes, Mayuri died tragic deaths, over and over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001090)
But now, she's alive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A0)
This is a natural scene.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B0)
This is why I sacrificed Suzuha's memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C0)
I'm sorry, Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D0)
Thank you, Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E0)
I give these two feelings to Suzuha, who no longer exists now in 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F0)
--No, Suzuha might still be close by.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001100)
Where in Akiba could the 54 year old Suzuha be?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001110)
I'll try asking Tennouji tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001120)
Because Tennouji is most likely indebted to Suzuha in this world line too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001130)
I wonder if Suzuha remembers me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001140)
【Mayuri】...hey, hey, Okarin
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001188)
Suddenly, Mayuri lifts her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001198)
A bewildered look floated in her expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A8)
And her cheeks were slightly dyed pink.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B8)
【Rintaro】What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C8)
【Mayuri】Don't you what me-. If you keep staring at me like that, it gets Mayushii all nervous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D8)
【Rintaro】Did it make you get a Game Over?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E8)
【Mayuri】Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F8)
【Rintaro】Sorry about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001208)
I apologize, but keep looking at her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001222)
Without going back to play her game, Mayuri looks at me concerned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001232)
【Mayuri】Okarin, something feels different about you today, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001242)
【Rintaro】R-really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001252)
【Mayuri】Yeah. What's wrong-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001262)
Mayuri is unexpectedly sharp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001272)
I understood that when she found out that Suzuha's father was Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001282)
I don't want to worry her too much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001292)
I want Mayuri to smile optimistically like usual, without anything to worry about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A2)
Because it's already over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B2)
【Rintaro】Hehehe, nothing has changed about me. I wasn't looking at your face just now; I was thinking about how to bring chaos to the world. Fuhahaha
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C2)
【Mayuri】Really-? You're not overworking yourself?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D2)
【Rintaro】For an insane mad scientist there is no such thing as overwork. For these brain cells of mine, having an IQ of 170, are always cranking out perfect calculations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EC)
【Mayuri】I see-. But you need to relax and take a break every now and then. Please don't forget, okay, Okarin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001308)
Having said that, Mayuri returns to her game.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001318)
I feel cold glances pour on me from my surroundings, but I don't care at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001328)
Mayuri is here with me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001338)
This is a normal scene.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001348)
I can finally return to "normal" things--
<FILEEND2D>
