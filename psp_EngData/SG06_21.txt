The next day. When evening comes, I assemble each lab mem except for Kurisu to Radio Kaikan to check their progress.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F4)
Radio Kaikan's rooftop is boiling hot even in the evening.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000804)
When I provide the time machine repairman Daru with the refreshing gift of cola, his sweaty face looks lightened up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084C)
【Itaru】Oh-, Okarin! You're giving me an ice cold zero calorie cola, how thoughtful of you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000868)
Daru happily takes the cola and chugs it straight from the bottle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000878)
Daru and Suzuha have a one-on-one discussion about the time machine's structure, while Mayuri and I watch from a distance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C0)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, Okarin. That satellite was a time machine. What a surprise, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D0)
【Rintaro】Yeah, sure was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008EA)
【Mayuri】It stuck into the building, but I'm glad that Suzu-san's safe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000904)
【Mayuri】She said it's really hard to drive-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000914)
【Mayuri】If the gravitational whatchamacallit device gets the coordinates the slightest bit wrong, the whole time machine becomes a Jellyman and it goes all ploop ploop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000924)
【Mayuri】And since that time machine isn't made by SERN, she said it's not all that stable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093E)
【Mayuri】I'm worried about when she goes to 1975-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000094E)
【Mayuri】If it's a two seater, then I could go with her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000095E)
【Rintaro】What are you going to do if you go with her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000978)
【Mayuri】Obviously- I'd hold Suzu-san's hand super tightly, and tell her that it's okay since Mayushii's here, cheering her on-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000988)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A2)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, Okarin, does that time machine have a name, you think-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B2)
【Rintaro】If you're interested, then just ask Titor directly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009CC)
【Mayuri】Ah, that's right-. Mayushii completely forgot. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2A)
Mayuri optimistically runs to Suzuha and comes back quickly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3A)
【Mayuri】Yup. It has a name-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4A)
【Mayuri】FG204 Something Something, she said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B64)
【Mayuri】Anyway, don't you think that Daru-kun and Suzu-san really match-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B74)
I look at Daru and Suzuha again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B84)
【Rintaro】Daru's a Faris moe kind of guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B94)
【Mayuri】Ah, I see-. Is that so?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA4)
She tilts her head to the side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBE)
【Mayuri】Heyhey, can Mayushii get a better look at the time machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCE)
I nod, and Mayuri rushes towards the time machine again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEA)
I can clearly see the sunlight sloping as the sun sinks from the rooftops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFA)
As the sunset fades into twilight, Suzuha stands beside me as if to change places with Mayuri. The setting sun stretches our shadows.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6C)
【Suzuha】Hashida Itaru's amazing. With him working on the time machine at full speed, he said he might be able to fix it tomorrow if things go well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7C)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8C)
【Suzuha】Even though he looks unhealthy and lackluster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9C)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAC)
A refreshing breeze blows by.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBC)
It was quite hot just a while ago, but it finally seems like the temperature dropped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
【Suzuha】Umm... you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDC)
【Suzuha】If I don't say it now, I won't ever have another opportunity, so I'll say it now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEC)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFC)
【Suzuha】Are you listening?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
After a little hesitation, I nod faintly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
【Suzuha】I'm actually really grateful for you all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2C)
【Suzuha】When I fist came to this era, I didn't know anybody... It's completely different from my era where I did nothing but fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3C)
【Suzuha】This era is a lot more peaceful, so peaceful it really frightened me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4C)
【Suzuha】But now I have friends... no, comrades, that I can expose all of myself to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5C)
【Suzuha】I met people who lived before I was born, and everyone's working so hard for my sake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6C)
【Suzuha】That makes me feel very strange... but also very happy, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7C)
【Suzuha】Those are my true feelings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8C)
A story I've already heard once. And just like that time, Suzuha's has a very serious expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E82)
【Itaru】That time machine... it looks like it can only leap to the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
The truth I heard from Daru plays back in my head in an endless refrain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F00)
【Suzuha】I was able to come to this era and spend time with all of you. It was really fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F10)
【Suzuha】Or rather, every single one of you was selfish, had weird habits, and was too dense... actually, I thought "what's with these guys?" at first.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F20)
【Suzuha】But before I knew it, the times I spent with you all became fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F30)
【Suzuha】In 2036, everyone's too peaceful. There aren't any fights. Did you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F40)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F50)
I shake my head left and right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F60)
【Suzuha】Anyway, there aren't any fights. Any disputes, from the micro to the macro level, have all completely disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F70)
【Suzuha】But instead, everyone has dead eyes like fish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F80)
【Suzuha】Nobody has any aspirations. They just shuffle their feet forward.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F90)
【Suzuha】People do smile, but they don't get angry or sad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA0)
【Suzuha】Nobody has any individuality. Everyone's like a robot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB0)
【Suzuha】Just before, you got really mad at me, didn't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC0)
【Suzuha】Back then, it really surprised me. It was a big shock, but at the same time... I was really happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD0)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE0)
Suzuha looks to the time machine. Right next to it, Daru and Mayuri are having an optimistic conversation about something or another.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF0)
【Suzuha】Everyone in your lab is so lively... so radiant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001000)
【Suzuha】Shiina Mayuri and Hashida Itaru... and Makise Kurisu. And you, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001010)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001020)
【Suzuha】I wanted to be like you guys.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001030)
【Suzuha】The reason I can work this hard is also because I met you guys.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001040)
【Suzuha】Being a lab mem for even just a little while... was great.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
Another serious smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001060)
So serious she might cry at any moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001070)
So serious she might break at any moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001080)
That smile, was so fragile--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001114)
【Suzuha】Being with you guys for even just a little while... was great.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001124)
Suzuha obviously knew from the beginning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001134)
That if she traveled to 1975, she could never return.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001144)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro. I'm sure you'll change the future. You'll change it into a world, free like the present.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001154)
When I heard this story before, I thought she was sentimental because she couldn't return to her original 2036, but that's not the case.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001164)
Forget about her original 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001174)
She can't even return here to 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001184)
Unless she ages to 54.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001194)
The "present" us and the "present" Suzuha can never meet again--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A4)
That's the mission Suzuha chose herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B4)
The mission to change the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C4)
The mission to save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D4)
Unless Suzuha leaps to 1975, Mayuri can't be saved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E4)
But then, what about Suzuha?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F4)
She threw away the era she lived in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001204)
And now she's throwing away the era she spent with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121E)
What does Suzuha think about that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000122E)
【Rintaro】...memories
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000123E)
【Suzuha】Hm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000124E)
【Rintaro】Do you regret making memories?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
【Suzuha】...What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001278)
【Rintaro】...Since you're going to 1975 anyway, do you not regret getting along with us here in 2010?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001288)
【Rintaro】If you didn't, then you only would've had to throw away one "trace of living".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001298)
【Rintaro】Because in actuality, it's like you're killing off your own existence, twice--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A8)
【Suzuha】...Did Hashida Itaru tell you by chance?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C2)
Suzuha gets angry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D2)
【Rintaro】He's worried about you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E2)
【Suzuha】Geez. I even made sure to say not to tell anybody.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F2)
【Rintaro】So, what? What do you think about going to 1975?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130C)
【Suzuha】...I don't have any other choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131C)
Suzuha's expression became suddenly cold.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132C)
【Suzuha】I need to go. That's the path I chose, and my father's dying wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133C)
【Rintaro】What if Daru or I stop you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001356)
【Suzuha】I'll ignore you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001366)
【Suzuha】I said so on @channel, too. That I need to be careful because even my thoughts could change the past and influence hundreds of millions of people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001380)
【Suzuha】But... I don't want the future to turn out like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001390)
【Suzuha】I want to give the people of my era a lifestyle like all of yours, with freedom, smiles, and occasional fights, arguments, and sad times too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A0)
【Suzuha】If I change the future, then I'm sure neither Father, nor Shiina Mayuri, nor you will be killed by SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BA)
【Suzuha】It might just be for my ego, but I'll go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CA)
【Rintaro】You don't care what happens to yourself for that cause?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
【Suzuha】What are you saying~? The 70's isn't a bad time, right? There, I'll find fun friends just like you guys, and live free. Ahaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F4)
Suzuha is bright, to the very end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001404)
But she surely came across considerable conflict and take heroic decisions just to get here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001414)
With that in consideration, I think it's impossible for words like mine to waver that will.
