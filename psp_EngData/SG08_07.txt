We arranged to meet tomorrow morning, so I hurry up and leave the shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E0)
I breathe a sigh of relief when only a few other people are passing over Manseibashi bridge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
【Kurisu】So?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
Kurisu calls out while walking behind me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
I had her wait outside the torii, but she was completely useless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000864)
【Kurisu】So in the end, you started going out with her? Well, I can kind of guess based on Urushibara-san's reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000874)
【Rintaro】You, you saw that!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088E)
【Kurisu】You told me to watch it, didn't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089E)
Oh yeah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AE)
In the end, she just stood there without being any use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BE)
【Rintaro】...looks like we're going on a date tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D8)
【Kurisu】Hmmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E8)
Kurisu makes a small nasal sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F8)
She hasn't looked my way for a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000908)
【Kurisu】Our little insane mad scientist is dating a high school girl, huh. That's not insane at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000918)
【Rintaro】Guh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000928)
Why that... Kurisu talks full of sarcasm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000938)
Let's ignore her and just go to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000954)
But just as I quicken my pace, she grabs my shoulder, pulling me back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000964)
I almost fell backwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AC)
【Rintaro】What was that for!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BC)
【Kurisu】Sorry. I was getting a little irritated, so it was hard to talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009CC)
Kurisu didn't say what it was that irritated her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009DC)
Instead she rubbed both of her temples.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009EC)
【Kurisu】You made this choice to save Mayuri. I'll change my way of thinking too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A06)
【Kurisu】So, for your date tomorrow, do you have any plans?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A16)
Date plan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A26)
I told Lukako I'd think about it until tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A36)
I didn't say anything clear at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A46)
Even though it's for the sake of saving Mayuri, I can't help but feel uneasy about the whole thing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A60)
【Kurisu】So, what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A70)
Uh, let's cut through this with Hououin Kyouma...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A80)
【Rintaro】...Assistant of mine, let me tell you one thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A90)
【Rintaro】Born with the same IQ of 170 as Isaac Newton, I, Hououin Kyouma, am an insane mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAA)
【Kurisu】So?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABA)
【Rintaro】Naturally, as a mad scientist, what interests me more than women, is research, the destruction of the ruling structures, and the creation of chaos--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD4)
【Kurisu】You look like nothing but a virgin. It really seems li--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE4)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFE)
【Kurisu】...Hah!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B18)
【Kurisu】...P, pretend you didn't just hear that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B28)
【Rintaro】Damn... you assistant...! You really dared to bluntly point out the truth...! I won't forgive you, ever!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B42)
【Kurisu】S-sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B52)
【Rintaro】Anyway, what about you!? You have so much dating experience you can lecture me about it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B62)
【Kurisu】Ugh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B72)
Christina's face warps oddly for just a second, but I didn't miss it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B82)
【Rintaro】Look at you! You've spent all your time on study and research, so you have zero experience, don't you!? You spent lonely youthful days in America land! Ehh!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9C)
【Kurisu】Shut up! Is being a virgin so bad!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAC)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC6)
【Kurisu】...Hah!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE0)
【Kurisu】Ah... awhawha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF0)
【Rintaro】Screaming "virgin" in the middle of Akiba as an 18 year old genius girl... huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C00)
That's such a controversial statement it wouldn't be weird if it got picked up on various blogs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C10)
Thankfully, it's early morning, but the few pedestrians still grin when they noticed Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2A)
【Kurisu】L-let's get out of here!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3A)
Kurisu starts walking hurriedly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9E)
【Kurisu】What's important for a first date with a girl is to make a good impression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E70)
【Kurisu】An unclean appearance is out of the question. A haircut is especially important. Long hair looks dirty, so it's No Good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F14)
【Kurisu】As for clothes, you should wear something exactly the right size. In Akiba especially, it's trendy for young men to wear baggy clothes, but it looks sloppy, so it's not good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB8)
...So why exactly am I in a maid cafe, getting first date advice, from my younger assistant (who is also a girl)?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
【Kurisu】On the first date, both parties can be nervous, so conversation tends to break. What's important is to play conversation catch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001100)
【Kurisu】One sided conversations aren't fun for the other person. Girls especially like to talk, so guys should listen and keep the conversation turning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A4)
【Kurisu】Not just by listening, but throwing in appropriate responses is necessary. That'll make the girl think "He's really listening to me".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001252)
【Kurisu】Basically everything you're not, Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F6)
【Kurisu】But for now, start with talking normally. Ah, that idiotic laughter of yours is obviously prohibited.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A4)
【Kurisu】You're not gentle with girls in the first place. You talk too pompously. You fire off nonsensical delusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001448)
【Rintaro】Hey! You're just reading out of a dating manual book, so stop looking down on me, you American virgin, you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EC)
Our class of romance illiterates is studying out of a dating manual book we just bought from a bookstore.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159A)
【Kurisu】Who're you calling an American virgin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163E)
【Rintaro】Who else but you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016EC)
【Kurisu】Yeah, whatever, you virgin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001790)
【Kurisu】Do you know the saying "If a key opens many locks, it's a master key; if a lock is opened by many keys, it's a shitty lock"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001834)
【Rintaro】That's not a saying. That's more like a low level argument finisher.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E2)
【Kurisu】...true. It's kind of ineffective.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001990)
【Kurisu】But this dating manual actually has some interesting things written.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A34)
Kurisu is flipping through the manual on top of the table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADC)
【Kurisu】Like "walk casually on the side of the road" or "It's prohibited for girls to bring out money".
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF6)
 Okay? For your date tomorrow, you need to abide by all of these rules.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9E)
I wonder if I really can be that careful...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4C)
【Kurisu】Ummm, after that, there's... carry a clean handkerchief. When the girl goes to sit on a park bench, spread it out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF0)
【Rintaro】I'm not a caretaker.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9E)
【Kurisu】That's what it says, so there's no helping it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4C)
【Kurisu】For meals, avoid standing soba stalls or fast food. Family restaurants are borderline. Anything else depends on your budget.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF0)
【Rintaro】Family restaurants are borderline...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F94)
What family restaurants are there around Akiba...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002038)
【Kurisu】Come to the meeting place at least 15 minutes beforehand. Tardiness prohibited.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DC)
【Rintaro】15 minutes beforehand...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000218A)
【Kurisu】After that's a date course, huh. Movies, art galleries, strolling through town, and meals all seem safe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000222E)
【Rintaro】I see, that's unexpectedly simple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D2)
【Rintaro】I was almost certain that a first date required going to a beautiful beach resort, exchanging your first kiss bathed in the light of the setting sun and stuff--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002380)
【Kurisu】Ah, that's really romantic!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242E)
【Kurisu】...no, that's a wild virgin imagination. You've had too much manga and dramas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D2)
【Rintaro】You too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002576)
【Kurisu】And your partner's a minor, so didn't you think it's filthy to bring her into a hotel?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000261A)
【Rintaro】...no, I didn't
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026BE)
The day I do that... is the day I run full speed on the path to Uho!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002762)
Not to mention how simple a girl Lukako is. If I brought her to a hotel, she'd probably faint from the shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002810)
【Kurisu】Well, we're just about done. How was it? Was my lecture a little helpful?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B4)
【Rintaro】It wasn't your lecture but the manual's lecture, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002958)
But strolling around town counts as a date, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029FC)
Then I don't have to waste money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B4E)
【Faris】Nyanya? Kyouma, are you going on a date with someoneya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C02)
Faris came to our table carrying drinks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CB0)
【Faris】Thanks for waiting♪ I'll make your iced coffee nyan♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D54)
As usual, she pours in milk and syrup right in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E02)
Kurisu looks on in great interest. Which reminds me, I guess this is her first time at a maid cafe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EB0)
【Faris】Is your partner Mayushii nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F54)
While carefully stirring Kurisu's iced coffee with a straw, Faris asks such an ambiguous question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FF8)
【Rintaro】Why'd you bring up Mayuri?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030A6)
【Faris】Hmmya? Not her nya? Then...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000314A)
Faris stares at Kurisu's face--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031F8)
【Faris】Is it this girl nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032A6)
【Kurisu】Hwehh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000334A)
【Rintaro】No, this is my assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033F8)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000349C)
Kurisu and I quickly exchange glances. With mutual bloodthirst. As sharp as a sword's blade. I swear I saw sparks fly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000354A)
【Faris】Then, some other girl nya? Kyouma's making moves on too many girls, nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035EE)
【Kurisu】Hoh... You're making moves on too many girls, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003692)
【Rintaro】What nonsense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003736)
No, well, I did hug Faris a while ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037DA)
Or so I say, but when was that? I'm certain it was on the 14th, so when I time leaped to the 12th, that fact should've been undone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003890)
That's kinda lonely, isn't it...
<FILEEND49>
