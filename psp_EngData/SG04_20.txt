#WRITE(PTR, $00000208)
Faris' dad seems like a nice man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000218)
He doesn't have the atmosphere of a pompous rich man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000228)
The sun is setting, but there are still many people in front of Akiba Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000238)
Foreigners stand out more than usual. Akiba Town is known throughout the world, so much so that people come from abroad just to buy consumer electronics and moe goods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000248)
But it's so hot outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000258)
Just walking is enough to open up every sweat gland.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000268)
The air conditioning at Faris' house was indeed comfortable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000278)
I want some in the lab too, but unfortunately, we don't have that kind of money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000324)
Anyway, how about we go eat somewhere?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C8)
Thinking that, I look back at Daru and Mayuri behind m--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000532)
Mayuri's not there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D6)
【Rintaro】Mm...? Where'd Mayuri go?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000684)
【Itaru】Hm? Huh? Now that you mention it, she disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000728)
Did Stardust Shakehand activate again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085E)
I check my surroundings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000902)
And then I see Mayuri from behind, casually walking toward the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A6)
She's already about 50 meters away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
I chase after her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B80)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, where are you going!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5C)
【Mayuri】Ah, Okarin-. You know, Mayushii's going home after this, but she's thinking about going to drop by Nakano.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D00)
【Rintaro】If you're going home, then why didn't you say so?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAE)
【Mayuri】Ehhehe-. Sorry. But you know, whenever I think I gotta go to Nakano, that's all I can think about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8A)
【Itaru】Mayu-shi's ability to erase her presence is abnormal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCE)
Mayuri does this a lot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001072)
She staggers off somewhere without saying anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001116)
And just like Daru said, we really can't sense her presence at those times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BA)
That's why she always surprises me with the illusion that she disappears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000125E)
Stardust Shakehand and Sneaking Fadeout. Truly troublesome abilities.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A0)
【Rintaro】What business do you have in Nakano, anyway?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C6)
【Mayuri】Well, a "Sorrow Sword" doujinshi came out yesterday-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E0)
【Itaru】Porn?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F0)
【Mayuri】No. But the artist is "Kouka Yui-san". Mayushii's thinks it's time to get serious-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001412)
【Itaru】Heh, Kouka Yui, huh-. The character designer for last year's <DICT>Gunbum</DICT>, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142C)
【Mayuri】Yup. That's right-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000143C)
【Itaru】Buy me one too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001456)
【Mayuri】Okidokey-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001466)
【Rintaro】Hey, hey, what are you guys saying? If you want doujinshi, why not go to Toranoana right there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001484)
Daru and Mayuri stare blankly at my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001494)
【Mayuri】There, where-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A4)
【Rintaro】No, by there, I mean there. Right over-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000154C)
I point my finger--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000155C)
Not at Toranoana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156C)
【Rintaro】Wh...at...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001588)
I rub my eyes and blink several times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001598)
I stare at it again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A8)
I thought maybe I got the wrong place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
But I couldn't find it no matter how much I searched.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
On the contrary--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
Toranoana's neighbor, animate, disappeared too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E8)
In their place are electronics stores.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F8)
Furthermore, those electronics stores are unfamiliar, Daiichi Kaden and T-2ONE Minami.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001696)
No, wait...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A6)
I remember hearing from Mister Braun that Akiba used to have a whole bunch more electronics shops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B6)
Several shops have already closed. I think Daiichi Kaden and T-2ONE Minami were among them...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171A)
【Rintaro】Toranoana and animate- where did they go!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001790)
【Itaru】Are you telling a joke by any chance?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A0)
【Rintaro】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B0)
【Mayuri】There aren't any Toranoanas or animates in Akiba, you know-? That's why Mayushii's going to Nakano to buy doujinshi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C0)
【Rintaro】...What do you mean there aren't any!? They were just there yesterday, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D0)
What about today?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E0)
When we went to Faris' house, I didn't clearly see them, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FA)
【Itaru】There aren't any. It's not like there would be any moe shops in Akiba anyway. The moe holy land is Nakano, durr.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180A)
【Rintaro】Isn't Akiba more famous worldwide as the moe holy land?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001824)
【Itaru】Has the heat finally gotten to you, Okarin? Akiba is the electric town. If you made a moe shop, then the maniacs would start a rebellion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C2)
The conversation doesn't connect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D2)
This feel... this feeling...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E2)
I'm frustrated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F2)
The past changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001902)
I notice from the corner of my brain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001966)
But I still can't help but ask.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001976)
【Rintaro】"Mandarake?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001986)
【Mayuri】None-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001996)
【Rintaro】Akibaoo~!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019B0)
【Itaru】That's normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C0)
【Rintaro】I mean Akibaoo~koku, where they sell doujinshi!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D0)
【Itaru】The hell's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EA)
【Mayuri】They sell doujinshi at Akibaoo~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A04)
【Itaru】No way. That's impossible by any means.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A14)
【Rintaro】Gamers!? Ramutara!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2E)
They shake their heads.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3E)
【Rintaro】MelonBooks!? Asobit City!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A4E)
They give back confused looks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5E)
So basically--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A6E)
I take a deep gulp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A8A)
I finally understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A9A)
It's too unreal, but I understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AAA)
【Rintaro】This town's chaos... is dissipating...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ABA)
Only the otaku pandering shops, selling anime and eroge, have completely disappeared from Akiba Town--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE8)
For the final desperate struggle, I run to the usual spot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF8)
"MayQueen+Nyan⑯".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C08)
The maid cafe where Mayuri and Faris work, and Daru and I frequent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C18)
But upon arriving in front of that store, I could do nothing but stand stock still and surrender to the finishing blow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C78)
【Rintaro】Gone--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C88)
It's lost.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
Not just the moe shops, but even the maid cafe disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA8)
Not just MayQueen, but the other multitudes of maid cafes and cosplay service stores have probably disappeared too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF0)
【Rintaro】Mayuri. You work at MayQueen, don't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D0A)
【Mayuri】MayQueen? What's that-? The potato?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1A)
【Rintaro】"MayQueen+Nyan⑯"!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D62)
I try asking Daru too, but to no reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D7C)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's part time job is at Lemoine, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D8C)
【Rintaro】Lemoine? Is that a maid cafe?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9C)
【Mayuri】No. A normal coffee shop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DAC)
【Rintaro】...Is there even a single maid cafe in Akiba?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC6)
【Itaru】None. The people who come to Akiba are prejudiced against that sort of moe business. Nobody would go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD6)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF2)
It's already definite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E02)
This is most likely an influence of Faris' D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E12)
The Butterfly Effect Kurisu talked about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB0)
Faris said she had participated in Akiba's city development conferences ever since she was little. And that, adopting her opinion, they increased the moe shops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC0)
And by sending a D-mail to 2000 directly, or indirectly negating that, the world line was reconstructed to one with an Akiba without those stores.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED0)
I guess that's it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE0)
To think that a single mail could rewrite ten years of a town's history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF0)
Is it okay to repaint the town's appearance to our convenience-- no, Faris' convenience?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F00)
I almost felt guilty about it, but since I'm the only one who remembers the original Akiba, nobody can blame me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F10)
I can't do anything about the changes after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F20)
But still, just what did Faris send...?
<FILEEND59>
