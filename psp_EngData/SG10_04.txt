There aren't many people in Akiba today either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001FC)
I guess it's because everyone made the Volkerwanderung to Ariake for ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
But when night falls, the returning ComiMa patrons will come marching in full force, and there will be more people than ususal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000021C)
Leaving Daru aside, I guess Mayuri went to ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000022C)
I would rather her not go. I want things to be as they usually are.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000318)
Those feelings I heard from Mayuri before her grandmother's grave yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000328)
I guess she's been thinking about a lot of things in her own way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000398)
Parting from Mayuri after I sent her all the way home, I kept looking for an answer to whether or not there was a Third Choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A8)
All of the thoughts in my head floated and vanished. My brain's a mess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B8)
I thought too much, lost my grip on what's right and what's wrong, but there's no right or wrong choice in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C8)
In the end, the last nagging question left was still Who do I let die?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003D8)
And no matter how much I danced around it, the answer was the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003E8)
I can't chose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F8)
I wanted someone else to answer for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000408)
But it's obvious that even if I entrusted it to someone else, I would just reject whichever choice they made.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000052C)
I come to Radio Kaikan's rooftop again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000053C)
If I stay in the lab now, it'll choke me up. When I think I'll bump into Mayuri or Kurisu, I can't calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000590)
I look up to the sky, and it's covered with clouds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A0)
An evening shower could happen any minute now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C8)
【Rintaro】...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D8)
I thought the rooftop was empty, but there's a previous visitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E8)
Kurisu is in the center of the wide rooftop, sprawled out as if in the middle of a snow angel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EA)
For a moment, the sight of Kurisu collapsed in a puddle of blood floats through my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FA)
No way, is she dead!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070A)
I rush over to her, thinking that, and Kurisu abruptly gets up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075E)
【Kurisu】...oh, Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076E)
【Rintaro】You're alive...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077E)
After murmuring that, I think "Oh, crap" and quickly shut my trap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000078E)
In any case, it doesn't look like she heard me. Kurisu doesn't particularly react; she just adjusts her disheveled hair with her hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000079E)
I breathe a silent sigh of relief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007AE)
【Kurisu】Oh right, I forgot about the possibility I'd meet you if I came here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007BE)
【Rintaro】What were you doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D8)
【Kurisu】...thinking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E8)
【Rintaro】Oh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F8)
About her own death...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000808)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000818)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000828)
Unable to find my next line, I say no more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000838)
Kurisu seems the same way, looking at a capsule toy with her usual sour look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000848)
An awkward air drifts between us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000858)
If you think about it, I myself am holding Kurisu's fate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000868)
My decision decides if Kurisu lives or dies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000878)
Yesterday's ridiculous fantasy theory was her way of forcibly constructing an I don't die theory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000888)
Even if that theory were true, she still might think about death in these circumstances after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000898)
Getting uncomfortable staying there, I force a smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A8)
【Rintaro】It looks like I'm in your way, so I'll just go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C2)
【Kurisu】...Ah, okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D2)
Another anticlimax. Usually she'd just give a sarcastic remark like Well, this is the first considerate mad scientist I've ever seen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E2)
And then, something cold gently plops onto my nose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099C)
When I look up, raindrops keep falling on my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AC)
It's finally raining. It's an evening shower, so it'll get intense soon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BC)
Kurisu doesn't move from there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009CC)
Instead, she folds her arms and hangs her head as if she doesn't notice the rain falling at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009DC)
【Rintaro】Hey, it's raining.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009EC)
【Kurisu】Eh? Ah, mmm, yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009FC)
Kurisu's acting strange.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0C)
Like she's there in body but not in spirit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1C)
So what she's "thinking" about is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A50)
【Rintaro】Wait, wahh!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A60)
After just a short while, the rain turns into a downpour.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A70)
No time to seek shelter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A80)
【Kurisu】What the hell is thiiiiisss!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A90)
Kurisu's screaming voice seems to disappear in the roaring of the pouring rain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF4)
【Kurisu】Ah, what a shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C04)
【Rintaro】Don't underestimate evening showers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C14)
We take shelter inside and catch our breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C24)
It's been a week since the satellite-- Suzuha's time machine disappeared, but Radio Kaikan is still closed. So the lights inside are off, making it fairly dark.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3E)
【Kurisu】Warn me sooner. Now even my underwear's wet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4E)
【Rintaro】Same here. You got saved by the darkness, huh, Assistant?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5E)
【Kurisu】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6E)
【Rintaro】If Radio Kaikan were open, your current unladylike figure would be exposed to countless people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C88)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C98)
Even in the dim light, I can tell Kurisu hurriedly hides her breasts with both hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA8)
【Kurisu】Ugh, I forgot... you were a pervert too...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB8)
【Rintaro】You're the one who reported your underwear's wet status.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC8)
【Kurisu】J-just stop talking. I won't forgive you if you're imagining what color my underwear is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD8)
【Rintaro】I'm not imagining it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE8)
How overly self-conscious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF8)
But the color of her underwear, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D08)
Hmmm... is it white after all?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D22)
【Kurisu】Ksh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D32)
【Rintaro】Are you cold?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4C)
【Kurisu】"Then take your clothes off to dry", huh? D-don't screw with me. I won't fall for your perverted mind tricks--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5C)
【Rintaro】Nobody said that! Calm down a little!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6C)
【Kurisu】Mmm....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7C)
【Rintaro】Well, even if you did take your clothes off, you don't have to worry. In this darkness, it's not like anyone can look at your thin nude figure--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D96)
【Kurisu】If you say any more, I'll cook your cerebral neocortex in ponzu and serve it in a high class restaurant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA6)
【Rintaro】S-sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB6)
Please spare me that horror....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC6)
But if we cut the wise-cracks, all we can think of is serious business.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE0)
【Kurisu】If it's an evening shower, it'll end soon. Just wait it out I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFC)
In the darkness, Kurisu motions to sit on the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0C)
I sit next to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE0)
【Kurisu】Hey, wait, why are you next to me--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0A)
【Kurisu】W-why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1A)
【Rintaro】You're the one who said so, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2A)
【Kurisu】Don't come so close...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3A)
【Kurisu】That distance is the limit. I won't tell you to move further away, though... if you get any closer, I'll push you away, okay...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4A)
She gradually cools down. She starts shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5A)
Maybe it's best to strip down to underwear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6A)
But if I do that, then Kurisu would just call me a pervert again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7A)
Self restraint, huh....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8A)
My eyes gradually adjust to the darkness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEE)
They can start to grasp Kurisu's figure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFE)
She curls up her cold body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100E)
【Kurisu】...don't look this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101E)
【Rintaro】No way!? How can you tell where I'm looking in this darkness!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102E)
Does she have infravision!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103E)
【Kurisu】So you -were- looking then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104E)
Gah, Reflexive Response, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105E)
She used a high level technique...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108E)
I look away from Kurisu and take off my coat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109E)
Then I notice it's torn at the shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AE)
【Rintaro】Mm... Maybe it got caught on something when we came inside from the roof...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F6)
【Kurisu】What? What're you talking about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001106)
【Rintaro】Nah, there's a tear on the shoulder of my coat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001116)
【Kurisu】I didn't know Okabe was a clumsy girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001126)
【Rintaro】I have the attributes of a mad scientist, not the attributes of a clumsy girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001136)
It feels like it's been a long time since I've talked to Kurisu as Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001150)
【Kurisu】Okay, okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001160)
And then I barely see Kurisu reaching her hand this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117A)
【Kurisu】Come on, let me see it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118A)
【Rintaro】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A2)
【Kurisu】I happen to be carrying a <DICT>sewing set</DICT> so I'll stitch it up for you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B2)
【Rintaro】A sewing set? You?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CC)
【Kurisu】Something wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DC)
I obediently hand over my coat, tilting my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011EC)
【Rintaro】You're an experiment-loving girl, yet you have that sort of family-oriented thing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001206)
【Kurisu】I could be an experiment-loving girl and a family-oriented girl at the same time, can't I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
【Rintaro】You're a family-oriented girl?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001230)
【Kurisu】Relatively, maybe. Well, actually, I don't know the 'Family-oriented Girl Index' among Japanese high school girls, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001240)
the hell is that index... I've never heard of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
Kurisu skillfully threads the needle in the darkness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000126A)
【Kurisu】It's hard to thread it since it's wet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127A)
【Rintaro】...Did you really just happen to carry it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000128A)
【Kurisu】Shut it. Is it really that wrong for me to carry a sewing set?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129A)
【Rintaro】It's not wrong, it just seems like you did it on purpose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B4)
【Kurisu】So basically you're trying to say I anticipated your clothes would tear, so I prepared beforehand. I get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C4)
【Kurisu】No way in hell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DE)
【Kurisu】Don't get me wrong, but it's not like I'm sewing your clothes because I like you or anything, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EE)
【Rintaro】Oh look, a tsundere line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012FE)
【Kurisu】Don't mock me. You coincidentally happened to tear your clothes, and I coincidentally happened to have a sewing set. So I'm sewing it for you. That's all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130E)
【Rintaro】Coincidence, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131E)
【Rintaro】No way... you didn't time leap or anything, did you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001338)
【Kurisu】So basically you're trying to say I noticed your clothes tore, so I time leaped, preparing the sewing set beforehand. I get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001352)
【Kurisu】No way in hell. No way in hell. It's so important I said it twice. Comprendes?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001362)
【Rintaro】Certainly. If you time leaped on purpose, you wouldn't have brought a sewing set, but a towel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137C)
【Kurisu】What's that, sarcasm? All you do is complain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138C)
After moving her hands a bit, Kurisu cuts the string with her teeth, and hands my coat back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A6)
【Kurisu】Here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B6)
【Rintaro】Thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C6)
【Kurisu】Ah, yeah... Well, it was dark, so I couldn't really tell, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D6)
【Kurisu】If it turns out bad, it's not my fault. It's because it's dark, probably.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F0)
【Kurisu】By the way, look forward to finding out the thread's color.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001400)
【Rintaro】The color's random...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001410)
【Kurisu】Black, or red, or pink. Probability's about a third each.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001420)
【Rintaro】Let's hope it's not pink at least.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000143A)
【Kurisu】Ksh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000144A)
【Rintaro】Cold?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145A)
【Kurisu】I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146A)
【Rintaro】Want to put on my coat?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001484)
【Kurisu】But it's wet, isn't it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001494)
【Rintaro】Well, yeah, but
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A4)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B4)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D6)
Silence again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
Even though we talked wondrously when cracking jokes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F6)
After just one second of silence, we couldn't find another subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001506)
What happened yesterday makes it hard to talk after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001516)
Taking that into consideration, I try thinking of something to safe to talk about. I couldn't think of anything, so in the end, I stayed quiet. That's how things were.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001526)
【Kurisu】...come to a conclusion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000157A)
Kurisu whispers, holding her knees closer to her chest since she's cold.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158A)
Her voice wasn't very large, but in the silence of this empty room, I could clearly hear her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AA)
Conclusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BA)
I understood what that meant even without having to ask.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CA)
That's why I couldn't answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E4)
【Kurisu】Haah... You still worried?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FE)
【Kurisu】You like Mayuri, don't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160E)
【Rintaro】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161E)
Why's she saying that all of a sudden?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162E)
Kurisu is turned to the darkness without looking at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163E)
【Kurisu】I might just be seeing things, but in my mind I have strange memories like deja vu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164E)
【Kurisu】And in those memories, you're desperately trying to save Mayuri, getting hurt all alone, yet never turning away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165E)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166E)
The same as Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167E)
【Kurisu】And then that Okabe would turn to me for advice, and seeing him earnestly working his hardest would make me want to lend him strength too--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001692)
【Kurisu】Err,
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AC)
 it's not like I want to save you or anything okay!?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C6)
 I just want to save Mayuri, that's all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016DA)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F4)
【Kurisu】Anyway, I wonder why I still have those memory-like illusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001704)
So Kurisu also still has memories of previous undone world lines...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001714)
【Kurisu】I tried doing a self-analysis. Maybe those were dreams I thought were reality, or merely hopes, but I couldn't come to any other conclusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001724)
【Kurisu】But only this I know for sure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173E)
【Kurisu】You should save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174E)
【Rintaro】...you're not scared?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175E)
To save Mayuri, I must undo this current world line...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176E)
Which basically means killing Kurisu--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001788)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001798)
【Kurisu】It kinda feels like we're lost in the ruins.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A8)
Kurisu says that while shrugging her shoulders and looking around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
【Kurisu】It's like power is out all around the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D2)
【Kurisu】And like we're the only ones left behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E2)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FC)
【Kurisu】I just thought of something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180C)
【Kurisu】If you go to the β World Line. If everybody moves there with you at once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001826)
【Kurisu】And I'm the only one who doesn't. I'm the only one who stays.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001836)
【Kurisu】Then, will the entire world turn out like this place?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001846)
【Kurisu】But after all, that's just another hypothesis.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001856)
【Rintaro】...I
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001866)
I couldn't help but say it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001876)
【Rintaro】Will save you. Not just Mayuri, but you too--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001890)
【Kurisu】Don't talk about things you can't do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A0)
Kurisu flat out interrupts my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B0)
In the darkness. Kurisu covers her face by hugging her knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CA)
【Kurisu】You asked me earlier if I wasn't afraid, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E4)
【Kurisu】...of course I'm afraid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F4)
【Kurisu】I might disappear. I might be the only one left behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190E)
【Kurisu】Or possibly, you might be the only one to leave this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191E)
【Kurisu】Maybe the world will continue with nobody recognizing your disappearance, and I'll go back to America as if nothing ever happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001938)
【Kurisu】Maybe. Maybe. Maybe...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001948)
【Kurisu】Just thinking about all those possibilities makes me feel hopeless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001962)
【Kurisu】But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001972)
Then Kurisu lifts her face and glares at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001982)
【Kurisu】Are you saying it's okay to let Mayuri die just because of that!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001992)
【Rintaro】Kurisu...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AC)
【Kurisu】Aahh, whatever, it's kinda cold.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019BC)
Kurisu grabs her own arms.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019CC)
When I look closely, her shoulders are shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DC)
【Kurisu】It's cause of these wet clothes. Geez.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EC)
【Kurisu】No. That's absolutely illogical. That's not even an acceptable hypothesis. I just want to cut off the brain's ability to shoot out those good-for-nothing delusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019FC)
She keeps saying those words as if irritated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A0C)
Kurisu was always calm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A1C)
Whenever I saw her, I thought she was amazing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A2C)
So I thought she was calm this time as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3C)
But I was wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A4C)
She appeared to be calm, but that wasn't the case at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5C)
Now Kurisu's desperately trying to shut out the fear of denying her own existence. She's fighting that fear all by herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A6C)
There's no way she can't be afraid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7C)
No matter what you say, she's still an 18 year old girl after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B1C)
And then Kurisu abruptly gets up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2C)
I notice I no longer hear the sound of rumbling rain on the roof outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B3C)
The evening shower seems to be over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B84)
【Kurisu】Listen, Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B94)
【Kurisu】It's impossible to save us both. Correct?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAE)
【Kurisu】No matter how you struggle, the probability is still 50/50.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBE)
【Rintaro】But...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD8)
【Kurisu】No buts. I won't change my conclusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE8)
【Kurisu】Save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF8)
Heartbreaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C08)
But decisive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C18)
A voice with resolve.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C28)
I drop down on the spot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C38)
I clench my fists.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C48)
【Rintaro】Are you telling me to give up so easily? You telling me to just abandon you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C58)
【Rintaro】There's no way I can do that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C72)
【Kurisu】It doesn't matter if you can or not. You must. There is no other way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C82)
【Rintaro】No! You're my important comrade! I won't abandon you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C92)
【Kurisu】Okabe!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE2)
Kurisu approaches.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF2)
She gets on her knees before me, grabbing me by the collar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D02)
I groan since it's hard to breathe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D12)
Before my eyes is Kurisu's face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D22)
That face is sternly staring at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D32)
She was always like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D42)
Always glaring at me like this...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5C)
【Kurisu】Is there another solution? There isn't, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D76)
【Kurisu】I don't want to live so badly that I'd sacrifice Mayuri for it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
【Kurisu】If you don't save Mayuri, then I'll hate you forever!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D96)
【Rintaro】Guh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA6)
Frustration. Irrationality. Intolerability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB6)
The pitifulness of Kurisu saying this much about a decision that involves her own death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC6)
Tormented by those feelings, I want to cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD6)
I bite my lip to hold back the tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE6)
Can I really not do anything else?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF6)
I can't bear it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E06)
I turn to the body that's grabbing my collar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E20)
【Kurisu】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E30)
And strongly embrace it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E40)
A wet body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E50)
But a certainly warm body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E60)
【Rintaro】But, you're right here...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E70)
【Rintaro】This... this is too much...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E80)
【Kurisu】Okabe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E90)
From Kurisu's outstretched back,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA0)
From Kurisu's collar-grabbing hands,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB0)
All strength is drained.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC0)
And she entrusts that body to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EDA)
【Kurisu】...thank you. For worrying that much about me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EEA)
【Kurisu】But that's more than enough. I'm okay, so just think about Mayuri from now on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EFA)
Kurisu is resolved to fight fear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F0A)
So I have no more room for hesitation either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F1A)
What I need to decide here and now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F2A)
My decision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F3A)
The future of the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F4A)
Which comrade to let die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F5A)
I embrace Kurisu and whisper into her ears--
<FILEEND03>
