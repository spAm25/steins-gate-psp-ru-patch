【Kurisu】...Okabe?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
【Rintaro】Wasn't something weird about that girl just now...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
【Kurisu】That girl... you mean Nae-chan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
I nod.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085E)
【Kurisu】...she was almost like a different person.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086E)
【Rintaro】What does she mean she'll kill me in fifteen years?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087E)
It bothers me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088E)
Does this girl know something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089E)
What was she implying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B8)
【Kurisu】Okabe, don't worry about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C8)
【Kurisu】Send the D-mail right now. That'll solve everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D8)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E8)
I put FB's phone in my pocket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F8)
【Rintaro】I can't do it without seeing something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000908)
I'm partly responsible for that girl becoming a murderer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000918)
And I want to find out what she meant by kill me in fifteen years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000928)
【Rintaro】I'm time leaping. Back to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000942)
Kurisu faintly sighs, but I pretend not to hear it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B26)
TL24.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC0)
【Kurisu】Anyway, the enemy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
Kurisu glances at Moeka, then whispers into my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F22)
【Kurisu】Isn't she the enemy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F32)
【Rintaro】...It's 7AM now, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4C)
【Kurisu】Haah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5C)
【Kurisu】Yeah, but, why do you ask so suddenly?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6C)
After time leaping four hours from the lab development room, I'm in front of the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7C)
I remember hearing what Kurisu just said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8C)
After returning to Akiba from Narita Airport, we joined up with Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9C)
After this, the three of us go to Tennouji's house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
We're standing a bit away from Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBC)
Without holding her phone, she's tiptoeing and kicking the dirt in boredom.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCC)
Moeka, who was dead and bloody just a while ago, is perfectly calm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
That didn't really feel mysterious at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
Rather than getting paralyzed over it, I should have gotten used to this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFC)
Since I've already experienced Mayuri's death and rebirth several times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100C)
And so I know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101C)
After this, Moeka dies, and Manager dies, and there's nothing we can do to prevent that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102C)
So even though I came back, it's cruelly not to save those two.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
I can't do anything about it, and I'm not obligated to save them anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
The bigger problem is Nae.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000119E)
We arrive in front of Manager's house just like we did before I time leaped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AE)
This time, I wait outside with Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BE)
Moeka, ever expressionless, enters alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CE)
While waiting outside, I tell Kurisu what's going to happen after this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DE)
And to wait a little after hearing the gunshot before going inside and taking Manager's phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011EE)
The time before hearing that sound felt absurdly long.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011FE)
Finally--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001290)
【Kurisu】...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A0)
Kurisu loses her breath as her body goes stiff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B0)
【Kurisu】A gunshot actually...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001380)
I immediately check my surroundings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001390)
And just as Kurisu had said, I saw a girl come out of the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A0)
Her gait was firm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B0)
That's not the way an elementary schoolgirl walks after witnessing her father's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C0)
I quickly run in a way that hides the sound of my footsteps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D0)
【Rintaro】Wait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001418)
I call out, and Nae turns her head towards me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001502)
Those eyes full of hatred focus straight at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001512)
That alone is enough to make me shiver.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001522)
It's pitiful, but I'm nervous even though my opponent's such a small girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001532)
Something's just not right with that girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001542)
Something's wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001552)
This Nae is a different existence that seems like Nae...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BE)
I want to know her true identity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CE)
That's why I postponed changing the world line to time leap here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D0)
Though I told her to stop, Nae keeps running away without stopping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E0)
I also put all my strength into chasing that small back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001742)
I'm bad at physical movement, but my opponent's an elementary student.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001752)
The distance between us quickly shortens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001762)
Nae keeps glancing at me, but keeps running away, silently grinding her teeth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
That gesture doesn't seem childlike.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
When a normal kid gets chased by a big man, they'd cry and scream Don't come any closer- or Save me-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
But this girl isn't saying anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
She just keeps running wordlessly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B2)
【Rintaro】Stop!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
I call out to her once more when I'm close enough that I can touch her if I stretch out my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D2)
And unexpectedly, Nae's running speed drops, and she eventually stops, catching her breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183C)
【Nae】..., haah... ...ha ...ah
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000184C)
Looks like she gave up when she realized she couldn't get away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185C)
Judging by her rough breathing, I guess she's reached her physical limit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186C)
Kurisu and Moeka don't chase after us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187C)
Since everyone's off on Obon vacation, there aren't that many people on the residential streets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000188C)
This is perfect, since I'm afraid the police would label me as a pedophile rapist if they saw all that. Now I'll have this girl tell me everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189C)
While catching my breath, I call out to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B6)
【Rintaro】You, are you really Tennouji Nae?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C6)
【Nae】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D6)
Nae glares at me as she catches her breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E6)
【Rintaro】You plan to kill Kiryuu Moeka after this, don't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001900)
【Nae】That's right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001910)
She says so nonchalantly with a cruel smile on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001920)
Her expression isn't something a child could pull off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001930)
【Rintaro】Revenge for your father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001940)
【Nae】You and Kiryuu Moeka killed Daddy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001950)
【Rintaro】Manager killed himself. He blew his own brains out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001960)
【Rintaro】Even if I don't go, he kills himself, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001970)
【Rintaro】You're scapegoating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198A)
【Nae】I don't give a shit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199A)
She doesn't give a shit...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AA)
【Nae】When Daddy died, Kiryuu Moeka was there. But she didn't stop him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019BA)
【Nae】So I won't forgive her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019CA)
【Nae】Nor you, Okabe Rintaro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DA)
【Nae】You weren't there, but if you didn't butt in, Daddy wouldn't have died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EA)
So she means it would've been better if I didn't find the IBN 5100?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019FA)
That's a good place to scapegoat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A14)
【Nae】But I won't kill you now. 'Cause I can't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A24)
This little girl, who is so much shorter than I am.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A34)
Looks up at me with a cruel smile on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A44)
【Nae】I'll kill you in fifteen years. Stay scared until then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A54)
I go on my knees and grab Nae by the shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A64)
I hold back my fear and glare back at her at eye level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A74)
And yet this girl doesn't show any sign of faltering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A84)
【Rintaro】Who... are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A94)
She isn't Tennouji Nae.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA4)
【Rintaro】What does she mean she'll kill me in fifteen years?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB4)
【Nae】Exactly what it sounds like.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC4)
【Nae】Fifteen years from now, I "killed" you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD4)
Killed? Why is she using past tense when talking about the future?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE4)
Nae laughs even more provocatively.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF4)
She draws her face near, muttering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0E)
【Nae】Aha, you don't get it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B1E)
【Nae】Just now, didn't you say it? "Who are you?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2E)
【Nae】I am Tennouji Nae. No doubt about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B48)
【Nae】Except I "remember" my memories of fifteen years from now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B58)
I was aghast.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B68)
Don't tell me, she--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B78)
【Rintaro】Time...leap...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA0)
【Rintaro】!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB0)
Suddenly, Nae brandishes her knife.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC0)
Completely caught of guard, I couldn't avoid it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D94)
【Rintaro】Guh, aah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA4)
My right arm, which was grabbing Nae's shoulder, got cut near the elbow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB4)
A lot of blood spurted onto Nae's body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC4)
However, the girl before my eyes, holding the knife--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD4)
【Nae】Ahahahaha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE4)
Laughed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF4)
Laughed, just like she laughed when she killed Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E04)
【Rintaro】Damn...it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E14)
I fall because of all the pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E24)
I panicked for a moment, but somehow managed to convince myself that I'm fine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E34)
I'm fine. I won't die here. The world hasn't recognized that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E44)
It's just like Nae said herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E54)
It's not that the brat won't kill me. She can't kill me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E64)
I wouldn't die even if she tried to kill me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E74)
【Nae】Do you want me to tell you about your death?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E84)
【Nae】You're the founder of some resistance, and struck back against SERN, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E94)
【Nae】I abducted and confined you, and performed every which way of torture I could think of.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA4)
【Nae】You cried and screamed and shat and pissed yourself in pain while begging me for your life...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB4)
【Nae】It was really unsightly, Okabe Rintaro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC4)
【Nae】I couldn't do anything else, so after slitting your throat with my own hands, I stabbed you over and over to my heart's content. I don't even know how many times I stabbed you...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED4)
【Nae】And those are the last moments of your life. The fate waiting for you, who murdered Daddy...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE4)
Nae pries open the wound in my arm with her tiny little fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F50)
【Rintaro】Ugwahhh!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F60)
My nerves burn, not just in my arm, but throughout my entire body--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F70)
Pierced by that much pain, I can't hold back my screaming.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F80)
I can't shake off Nae's hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F90)
I can't move a single finger due to the pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA0)
【Nae】Aha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB0)
【Nae】SERN commandeered your Time Leap Machine, and kept custody of it for fifteen years. I had my eyes on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC0)
【Nae】Fifteen years from now, I, as a Rounder, killed you and then used it to come back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD0)
【Nae】It's a piece of shit that can't go back more than 48 hours in one go, so it was tough, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FE0)
To go back fifteen years with 48-hour time leaps, that takes, uh let's see--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FF0)
I can't calculate with all this pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002000)
【Nae】With a simple calculation, 2738 times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002010)
【Nae】Because various other things happen, so it's actually more than twice that, though. I've forgotten how many times I've time leaped...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002020)
Finally, I understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002030)
When I came to this world line, right after I learned Moeka commit suicide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002040)
When I came back to the lab, there was evidence that somebody had used the time leap machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002050)
So, basically, that was Nae's final leap...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002060)
Nae focuses on my eyes, and inserts her fingers even deeper into my wound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002070)
I bite my lip, frantically holding back the pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002080)
The blood won't stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002090)
The dripping blood stains the asphalt dark red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A0)
【Nae】I lived just for the sake of this revenge. I won't let anyone get in my way. I will absolutely kill Moeka. With "my own hands".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B0)
【Nae】I won't let her kill herself. I won't let her take the easy way out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C0)
【Rintaro】You came all the way back fifteen years...just for that...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D0)
She's become obsessed with revenge...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E0)
And the ones who originally changed this obedient and innocent little girl into this-- that is, the ones she resents-- are me and Moeka...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F0)
In other words, Moeka and I stole fifteen years of this girl's life.
 <END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002100)
Fifteen years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002110)
I can't truly grasp the significance of such an absurd amount of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002120)
【Nae】"Just for that" you say?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000215C)
Nae's slender fingers pry further into my wound. I can feel her touch my bone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000216C)
【Rintaro】Gah, gwaaah...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000217C)
【Nae】It might be "just for that" to you guys, but for me, killing you and Kiryuu Moeka means everything to me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000218C)
【Rintaro】So, you'll kill Moeka, and then... what next?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000219C)
【Nae】Next...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021AC)
【Rintaro】You're going to redo these 15 years you've come back...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021BC)
【Nae】Hmph, what does that matter...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021CC)
【Nae】It doesn't matter... at all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
Without tears. Without jeers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021EC)
Looking at this expressionless 11 year old girl, I have nothing more to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002290)
At last, Nae lets go of my arm. She takes a look at my blood on her hand as if it were cow manure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022AA)
【Nae】You don't have to do anything now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022BA)
【Nae】Just fear, and repent, Okabe Rintaro. Until we meet again fifteen years from now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C2)
I couldn't do anything but let Nae go after she spat out those words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D2)
【Rintaro】Ha, hahaha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E2)
Dry laughter unintentionally passes from my lips.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F2)
She's also an outsider to cause and effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002402)
I think over the questions I asked her again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002412)
What sort of life will Nae lead after killing Moeka?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242E)
The first time she lived those fifteen years, all she had was revenge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243E)
And after time leaping thousands of times, she completed her revenge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244E)
How will she live those fifteen years the second time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000245E)
Will she kill me again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000246E)
Will her revenge be complete after thirty years?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000247E)
How sad is that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000248E)
Maybe traveling back in time brings nothing but tragedy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000249E)
We made a time machine out of curiosity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024AE)
But we shouldn't have made it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024BE)
Then SERN wouldn't have targeted us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024CE)
Mayuri wouldn't have been killed either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024DE)
Suzuha wouldn't have needed to time travel to 1975.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024EE)
Faris wouldn't have had to experience her father's death twice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024FE)
Lukako would be a girl without any mental torment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000250E)
Moeka wouldn't have killed Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000251E)
【Kurisu】Okabe!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F2)
Kurisu rushes over to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002602)
Her face goes pale once she sees my wounded arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002652)
【Kurisu】How'd you get that wound!? Are you okay!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002662)
I peek at her worried face as she kneels in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002672)
【Rintaro】The phone...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002682)
【Kurisu】I brought it but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002692)
What Kurisu presents to me certainly is FB's phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E8)
I take it and begin typing the mail with my left hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002702)
【Kurisu】Hey, explain yourself! How'd you get that wound!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002712)
【Kurisu】Should I call an ambulance!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002722)
【Rintaro】Calm down...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002732)
【Rintaro】I'm sending the D-mail now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274C)
【Kurisu】Ah, I see. If the world line changes, then this wound will go away... huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000275C)
It should go away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000276C)
But my wound doesn't matter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000280A)
More importantly, when the world line changes, FB-- Manager's death, Nae's vengeful heart, and Moeka's death, will all be undone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028A8)
That's more important.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002946)
I finish the mail and take a breather.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C6)
【Rintaro】Hey, why didn't Manager... kill Moeka...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F6)
【Kurisu】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A1C)
Any member who has found an IBN 5100 has done their duty, and is silenced. Any member, without exception.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A42)
Manager certainly did say that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A68)
In that case, the one who should've been disposed of is Moeka, the one who found the IBN 5100 in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A8E)
And yet Manager cut contact with Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB4)
And when we made sure of Manager's true identity, he killed himself without killing Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ADA)
【Rintaro】...I've been thinking. Manager saved Moeka after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B00)
It's just my convenient way of thinking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B26)
Maybe I just wanted to feel satisfied convincing myself that was true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B4C)
At any rate, Nae will kill Moeka with her own hands in just a few hours, so even if Manager thought that way, it was meaningless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B72)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B98)
【Rintaro】It would be nice if that's how it is in the β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BBE)
They are the enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE4)
They are the ones I should hate for killing Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C0A)
But in some sense, Manager, and Moeka, and Nae too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C30)
They all might just be victims in my confusion of cause and effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C56)
I wish that at least, in my goal, the β World Line, they can all live proper lives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CC6)
That's why I have to send this D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD6)
【Rintaro】I'm sorry, Nae...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE6)
When I send the D-mail, this world line will be "undone"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF6)
【Rintaro】I won't let you exact your revenge...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DD0)
WD12.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031FC)
The world goes dim, loses its color, warps, and revolves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000320C)
Eventually, that sensation rectifies itself, the color returns, and I find out I'm standing in the street near the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003228)
The burning pain in my right arm suddenly softens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003238)
The open wound, and the flowing blood, also disappear completely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003248)
In its place, I'm holding a convenience store back with two bottles of Dr Pepper for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003258)
Probably because everything had been undone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003268)
I head straight for Moeka's apartment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003386)
 When I visit the apartment, Moeka opens the door and peeks out her face as usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033CE)
Her complexion doesn't seem bad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033DE)
It doesn't look like she's in despair that FB abandoned her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033EE)
There's no bloodstain near the door, and no fallen knife either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033FE)
No, Moeka's time of murder should certainly be past 10.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000340E)
【Moeka】Okabe-kun...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000341E)
【Moeka】Just how did you find...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000342E)
【Rintaro】Let me kill some time!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000343E)
I say so and force my way in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034DC)
...Moeka's time of death passed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034EC)
Nae didn't appear in the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034FC)
The world line changed after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000357E)
Right in ront of me, Moeka sends a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000358E)
It feels like it's been forever since she's sent so many mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035A4)
【Rintaro】Unnecessary? Who said?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003692)
【Rintaro】FB told you to stop...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036AC)
【Moeka】...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000372E)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000373E)
So FB is alive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003760)
I feel relief, and at the same time, impending doom.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003770)
Obviously, since the defeated enemy revived.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003780)
But there's no point in telling Moeka anything more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003790)
Did FB put a stop to the Rounder's duty of IBN 5100 retrieval?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003880)
【Tennoji】Doing your duty sets you up for "disposal". So we're more like livestock than dogs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038DA)
I play back that man's last words in my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038EA)
He put a stop to it so that she wouldn't be disposed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038FA)
If that's the truth, then maybe he really did do it to save Moeka after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039EA)
【Nae】Just fear, and repent, Okabe Rintaro. Until we meet again fifteen years from now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A44)
I wonder what happens with Nae.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A54)
I can't get that innocent yet hateful voice out of my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A64)
In that world line, I sparked the flames of homicidal revenge in such a young little girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A74)
I bite my lip hard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A84)
I'm not afraid of you. I won't repent either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A94)
Because that world line has already been undone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AA4)
Because vengeful obsession should've disappeared from your heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AB4)
Moeka hasn't died, which means that I've confirmed the world line has changed, and if things go as expected the IBN 5100 should have already come back to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AC4)
So there's no need to stay in this world line any more.
<FILEEND03>
