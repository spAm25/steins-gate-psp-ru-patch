My semicircular canals shake round and round like dice thrown down from a cup.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000049C)
The inverting floor returns to normal before I realize it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004AC)
I had teleported to the lab development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BC)
Standing right next to me is Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CC)
My demon eye, Reading Steiner clearly recognized the changing of the world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DC)
Additionally, the pain the Viral Attackers had inflicted on my body goes away. When I take a look, all injuries on my body have disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000530)
Faris is standing in the center of the room, looking around restlessly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000540)
All traces of tears had completely disappeared from her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000055A)
【Faris】Kyouma~. Do you know where Faris' phone is nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000056A)
The Faris who, until just a while ago, was facing me with a painful smile, is no longer here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000057A)
Instead, the one there was the usual simplistic, charming Faris with an impish smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000058A)
I look at the phone I'm gripping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000059A)
It's not my phone, but one with several cute, girly cat doll phone straps attached.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005AA)
【Rintaro】Your phone's here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C4)
【Faris】Nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000614)
Faris walks up to me with a teasing smile on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000624)
She pokes at my fingers with her index finger, twirling it around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000634)
【Faris】Kyouma... did you see that thing that's in here nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000644)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000654)
Faris gently takes the phone from my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066E)
【Faris】If you did see it, then please forget about it nya. That thing needs to stay sealed inside, nya. If not, those guys will awakenyan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067E)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000698)
【Faris】Hey, Kyouma!? This is where you put in a comeback nya! The usual Kyouma would say 'Whaddya mean that thing!?' and turn all red in denyial!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A8)
【Rintaro】...sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B8)
Before sending the D-mail, Faris said she didn't want to forget.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C8)
And I lied that she would surely remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DC)
【Faris】Today's Kyouma really is fishy, nya. Usually he'd show no restraint and act all pompous and--
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F6)
 nya!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070A)
I embrace Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071A)
Strongly, strongly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072A)
【Rintaro】I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000073A)
Faris remembers nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000081E)
Nothing about her victory at the RaiNet tournament.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BC)
Nothing about the Viral Attackers and their cronies chasing us around Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000962)
Nothing about her father who had gallantly ridden in on his limousine to save his daughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A08)
Nothing about how we had talked alone in her bedroom.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A78)
Nothing. She remembers nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A88)
Everything that happened in that world line was undone by that last D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A98)
What happens to that world line, I don't know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA8)
Possibly, just like Suzuha had said before, it might simultaneously exist even now through superposition.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
Or possibly, the instant the D-mail was sent, everything vanished at the flick of a switch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC8)
You'd have to be a god to correctly observe each and every world line, so thinking about it is pointless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD8)
But one thing's clear:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE8)
I can never return to that world line again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF8)
Faris can no longer talk to her father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B08)
So--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B22)
【Faris】Kyouma...? How, how bold nya... Mayushii's in the next room, she'll find out...? Nyahaha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B32)
【Rintaro】I'm sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B42)
I could do nothing but apologize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2E)
In this world line, Mayuri invited Faris to come play at the lab. That's how the cause and effect changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD2)
Seems like she came to see a costume Mayuri made.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E76)
Faris had to work after this, so she left the lab right afterwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2C)
After seeing Faris off, I head towards Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD4)
On the way, I stop at Chuo Dori and take a look around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001094)
【Rintaro】Everything came back...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001138)
The moe shops exist now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DC)
animate, Toranoana, Mandarake, Gamers, Lammtarra, Melon Books, Asobit City...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001280)
Each one of them revived in Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001324)
There's a gigantic anime hanging screen on Sofmap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C8)
Maids walk around the street handing out leaflets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146C)
Cosplaying girls are advertising in the storefronts of game shops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001522)
But I didn't feel any relief in my heart for the comeback of the familiar scenery.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C6)
The only thing grinding in my heart was confirmation of the fact that Faris' father was forever lost.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167C)
But now's not the time to stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001694)
I shake my head and hurry to the shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E4)
By the way, the satellite disappeared from Radio Kaikan's rooftop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F4)
Naturally, since it's past Suzuha's departure. My heart throbs again just thinking about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C0)
With this, the wounds within my heart have likely multiplied.
