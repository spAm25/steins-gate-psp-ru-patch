#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7A)
Just like before, the Braun Tube Workshop is closing a little bit early. Suzuha and Manager are about to come out, and Mayuri comes back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8A)
We pass through Kanda Shrine's backstreet to Ochanomizu Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9A)
In order to get to the Sobu Line before operations suspend, we run without considering the danger of running into assassins.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAA)
But in front of Ochanomizu Station wait men that look like assassins.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBA)
So we hurriedly change plans to take the Chiyoda Subway Line at Shin-Ochanomizu Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE4)
We arrive at the station surprisingly late.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF4)
I usually don't use this station, so I lost my way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D04)
Nervous, I stare at Shin-Ochanomizu Station's platform clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D14)
The Yamate, Keihin-Tohoku, and Sobu Lines have already suspended operations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D24)
The influence reaches even the Chiyoda Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D34)
It seems they've learned from previous terrorist bomb threats, and suspended operations of even directly unrelated lines for safety purposes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D44)
Don't tell me the subways are getting suspended too...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1A)
Mayuri doesn't complain about my abrupt behavior.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2A)
I've time leaped several times, but she always follows me without complaining.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3A)
Does she really trust me that much?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4A)
Maybe she can tell my urgency.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E5A)
That's why I want to save her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E6A)
We've been together for more than a decade.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E7A)
She's like a two years younger little sister to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8A)
I'll time leap any number of times if it can save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA4)
【Mayuri】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB4)
When I stare at her, Mayuri tilts her head with a troubled face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECE)
【Mayuri】You know, Okarin. Mayushii has a lot of questions to ask, but she'll wait for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDE)
【Mayuri】But in return, once it's over, I want you to tell me everything, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEE)
【Rintaro】Yeah, I promise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
Mayuri smiles happily at that answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F18)
That's right. While we wait for the train, I need to get as much info from Mayuri as I can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F28)
Hindsight is 2020.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F38)
【Rintaro】Where'd you go after meeting with Lukako?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F52)
【Mayuri】Fubuki-chan sent Mayushii an email that a problem happened with her costume. A thread came loose-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F62)
【Mayuri】I went to fix it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F72)
【Rintaro】Where does this Fubuki-chan live?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F82)
【Mayuri】Where does she live? We just met up at the Starbecks at UPX.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F92)
So that's what it was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA2)
And then an announcement of resumed operation floods through.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB2)
About 20 minutes have passed since we arrived at the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC2)
It's okay. I didn't expect to be stuck here 20 minutes, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD2)
At this time, Moeka should be in Akihabara, heading to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE2)
So it's okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF2)
While waiting for the train, I examine the route map on the station's noticeboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001002)
A direct private rail to Yoyogi-Uehara is in operation, so we might waste a little time, but it'll take us straight to Odawara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108C)
Then it's announced that the Yoyogi-Uehara train has arrived.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109C)
I see the train's light through the dark tunnel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AC)
It comes closer with a roar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CE)
Mayuri's standing in front, on the white line, waiting for the train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DE)
I'm standing next to her, holding her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EE)
But I let go when I realize we don't need to run once we're in the train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001106)
The roar comes closer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111E)
【Mayuri】Today's party
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000112E)
Mayuri turns and talks to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000113E)
I couldn't quite hear her over the train's sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001158)
【Mayuri】It's canceled, but someday we need to--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001168)
【Nae?】Mayuri-oneechan♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001334)
Suddenly, Mayuri disappears from view.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001344)
【Rintaro】--eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000148A)
Mayuri's body flies onto the railway tracks as if pushed--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000149A)
Immediately afterward, the train slides in with tremendous speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164E)
I think I hear a strange sound from under the train as it enters the platform.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165E)
A sound bringing physiological discomfort.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CE)
The train clearly slammed on the brakes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171C)
The people on the platform scream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172C)
Right next to me, in Mayuri's place--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173C)
Stands a familiar girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174C)
Around elementary student height. Innocent features.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175C)
Carrying a lovely black rabbit pouch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176C)
Tennouji Nae...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C8)
She looks up at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EA)
She opens her eyes wide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001836)
Her lips tremble with fear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C6)
【Nae】I...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D6)
【Nae】Found... Mayuri...onee...chan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E6)
【Nae】I wanted...to surprise...her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F6)
【Nae】It wasn't on purpo... it... wasn...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192A)
At a loss for words, she turns her back on me and starts running away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193A)
She disappears into the exit stairway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194A)
The platform is in chaos. The premise broadcasts inform of the accident.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EC)
I don't chase Nae.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019FC)
I timidly peek down through the gap between the train and platform.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5C)
One side. Red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B82)
My mind goes blank.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B92)
I can't think straight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA2)
I don't remember know how I got back to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB2)
Moeka's group should've come here long ago, but the Time Leap Machine is still here. Well, I'd be in trouble if they took it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE8)
I don't quite remember my own phone number, so I had a little difficulty inputting the machine's settings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF8)
Now, take me away--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D6)
