【Rintaro】Tremble, right arm of mine... Fulfill my desire. The desire of destruction. Thus returning dust to dust, ashes to ashes--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6C)
【Rintaro】Hrraahm!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADC)
I pull both arms in at full force, removing the microwave's door with an unpleasant sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEC)
The screws were loosened, but it seems to have snapped somewhere because I did it by force.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B04)
【Mayuri】Ahh~, this means I can't warm up any more karaage-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B14)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, this is no longer a microwave. It's a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B24)
【Mayuri】That's tyranny-. Then, Okarin, go buy a new microwave-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B34)
【Rintaro】I don't have that sort of money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B44)
And I'm doing this because its one of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) improvements Daru told me to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B54)
Removing the microwave door means we don't have to deal with the annoyance of opening it when we send D-mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB4)
Daru's tampering with the microwave's programming with the X68000. So he can disable the safety mechanism that stops the microwave when the door's open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC4)
He's already programmed the forwarding from a dedicated phone feature.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C18)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C28)
Moeka takes a picture with her phone camera.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C38)
I cover up the lens with my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C48)
【Rintaro】I told you photography is prohibited.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF4)
【Moeka】...Commemoration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D98)
【Rintaro】Commemorating what? Anyway, just don't shoot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E46)
Moeka obediently complies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEA)
I had only registered her as Lab Mem Number 005 just a while ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8E)
When the choices were to let her leak the time machine or to silence her by forcing her into our group, I reluctantly choose the latter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001032)
【Rintaro】Tch... I've gone too soft... Long ago, I would've already cut Shining Finger's life...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D6)
Moeka doesn't distance herself from me, even when I start monologuing right next to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117A)
Looks like she wants to ask something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121E)
【Rintaro】What is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C2)
【Moeka】...Is it really a time machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001366)
【Rintaro】It really is. I'll show you later. So you must not disclose it. Okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140A)
Moeka nods at my warning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
【Itaru】Alright, program complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F0)
After about thirty minutes of reading her technical book, Kurisu shuts it closed when she hears Daru's voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016FA)
【Kurisu】Then lets resume the experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170A)
【Mayuri】But-, won't Manager scold us again-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AE)
【Rintaro】Heheheh, don't worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. "I swear we won't shake the building any more today".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001852)
【Rintaro】Basically! The no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday's tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001900)
【Kurisu】That doesn't settle anything. Why you're so confident with yourself is a mystery to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A4)
【Rintaro】So in other words, is this what you want to say, Christina? "Kill him"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A52)
【Kurisu】No it's not!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B00)
【Kurisu】Besides, I don't think a wimpy man like Okabe could stand a chance against Manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAE)
【Mayuri】He's so muscley, you know-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5E)
With that said, it's impossible to experiment in this rickety old building without shaking it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D02)
I have no choice but to negotiate with Manager somehow. And then the remaining four people here turn their looks towards me in anticipation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA6)
Are they planning to sacrifice me...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4A)
【Rintaro】Tch, is that Steins;Gate's choice? ...however...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EEE)
Trying to think of a way to avoid talking to Manager, I spontaneously step up to the window and look out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F92)
【Rintaro】Hmm...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002082)
The road is down outside the window. Traffic is sparse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002126)
A single woman polishes her bicycle in front of the building. Squatting next to that woman, watching her work, is a girl. Those two are alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021CA)
From the window, I can only see the backs of their heads, but I know who they are without seeing their faces.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000226E)
【Rintaro】Hey, you Working Warrior!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002312)
When I call her, Suzuha looks left and right while wiping the sweat off her brow before finally looking up here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E2)
【Suzuha】Sup.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257E)
Suzuha and the girl beside her lift up their faces like fish caught on lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002622)
The silent girl is Braun Tube Workshop owner, Mister Braun's only daughter, Tennouji Nae. Looks like she came to play with her father today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C6)
I've always doubted just how it's even statistically possible for such a muscular man to give birth to...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000276A)
When Nae makes eye contact with me, she bows her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000280E)
I return a nod, and call out to Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D8)
【Rintaro】What are you doing there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000297C)
【Suzuha】Can't you tell by looking? I'm polishing my bicycle~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A20)
【Rintaro】Aren't you working today?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC4)
【Suzuha】I am~. I mean, that's why I'm here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B68)
You're polishing your bicycle even though you're at work?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C0C)
Does the Braun Tube Workshop have that much free time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CB0)
To put it bluntly, was there even a need for a part timer?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D54)
【Kurisu】Is she still tinkering with her bicycle?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF8)
I can hear Kurisu's sour voice from inside the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E9C)
【Kurisu】She was there when I a while ago, glaring her eyes out at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F40)
Seems she has a grudge against Kurisu like always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FE4)
【Rintaro】Hey, Working Warrior! What about Mister Braun?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003088)
【Suzuha】Mister Braun? Who's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000312C)
【Rintaro】The first floor junk shop manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031D0)
【Kurisu】It's not a junk shop, it's a Braun tube specialty shop, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003274)
Assistant's so picky. Junk shop was just a joke to add a little Hououin Kyouma spice to the mix.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003318)
【Suzuha】Ah-, is that who you meant by Mister Braun? Ahhaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033BC)
【Nae】Daddy's name isn't Mister Braun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003460)
The daughter diligently corrects us on her father's name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003504)
Doesn't look like she gets the joke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035A8)
【Suzuha】Manager's on a service trip~. I don't think he'll be back for a while~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000364C)
【Rintaro】Wh-what!? Is that true!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F0)
【Suzuha】It's true~. 'Cause otherwise, I wouldn't be out here skipping~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003794)
【Suzuha】Ah, Nae, keep that a secret from Manager, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384A)
【Nae】Then, let me ride your bicycle next time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003862)
This is such a blessing!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003872)
I give my gratitude to Working Warrior, shifting my attention back inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038CE)
【Rintaro】You heard her. This for sure is Steins;Gate's choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038DE)
【Rintaro】Currently, Mister Braun is absent. In other words, we can experiment to our heart's content!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038EE)
【Kurisu】So in the end, you're postponing finding a fundamental solution again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038FE)
【Rintaro】I'm saying it's Steins;Gate's choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003946)
【Itaru】That doesn't matter. For now, I just want to try out the Microwave Ophone 2nd Edition ver1.03.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000398E)
【Mayuri】Second ed-ed-shin verz erosion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039A8)
【Itaru】2nd Edition ver1.03.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039B8)
I don't really understand that model number, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039C8)
【Rintaro】Quit it with that unsophisticated naming. This improved version shall be called "Heavenly Merry-Go-Round".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E2)
【Kurisu】The name doesn't matter. Let's just start the experi--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A10)
A sudden shutter sound interrupts our quarrel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AA4)
Moeka has her phone camera turned this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AB4)
How many times have I told her not to take pictures...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ACE)
【Moeka】...Because, you looked happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BC2)
Mayuri smiles happily at those words. Daru shows no apparent change. Kurisu rudely turns away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BD2)
【Kurisu】No way. At the very least, I'm just fed up with this club.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF4)
【Itaru】Nevertheless, this assistant is a <DICT>tsundere</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C0E)
【Kurisu】Who are you calling a tsundere!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C28)
【Itaru】Ohh~, Makise-shi, you know what tsundere means?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C42)
【Kurisu】...I-I don't know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C52)
【Rintaro】It certainly looks like you do. It's written all over your face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C6C)
【Kurisu】Mmmgh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C86)
Kurisu bites her lip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C96)
Looks like she is accustomed to otaku culture after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CA6)
I wonder how she got that knowledge even when she's been living in America.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D3A)
【Moeka】...Quick, the experiment
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D4E)
Moeka's tired of waiting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D5E)
Ever since we told her the entire truth, this Shining Finger has been showing great interest in the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D6E)
Of course, she won't write an article. She signed a non-disclosure agreement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D7E)
If she violates it, I'll confiscate her phone by force and use it as a threat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E06)
The Microwave Ophone (Temp) can send a D-mail at any time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E4E)
【Itaru】Well, I'm setting it up so it forwards to Okarin's phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E6A)
Daru types my phone's mail address into the X68000's keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EB2)
We decided Mayuri was going to send the D-mails, so she started typing out mails on her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ECE)
We set the microwave timer to 60# and press the warm button. And even though the door is removed, the microwave still begins to operate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D2)
The discharge phenomenon occurs, and Mayuri's mail goes through the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s dedicated phone to my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044D6)
【Moeka】This is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044E6)
Moeka peeks at my phone screen, her breath taken away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044F6)
She's always expressionless so I don't know what she's thinking, but she actually seems surprised to see the D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000450C)
【Rintaro】What do you think? Now you should understand that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is an honest to goodness time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000451C)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000452C)
Without answering, Moeka just opens her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000453C)
【Suzuha】Hey~!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045B2)
Working Warrior calls from outside the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045C2)
【Suzuha】It's shaking again~! And there's even some strange light~! Just what are you doing!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045D2)
I decide to ignore the outfield jeer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045E2)
It would be a different story if it were Manager, but I'm not afraid of Working Warrior's objections at all.
