【Rintaro】Hey you there. Can you see us?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000035E)
【Rintaro】...Why don't you answer? I'm asking you. Yes you - the one in the other side of the monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000036E)
【Rintaro】Hmph that's a stupid face you're making. You're so boring.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000037E)
【Rintaro】To you it looks like we're inside a television monitor. Kukuku however that is incorrect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000038E)
【Rintaro】The one inside the monitor is you. The world that you think is reality is nothing but fiction. Of course that includes yourself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000039E)
【Rintaro】True reality is located on this side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003AE)
【Rintaro】You don't understand what I'm talking about? That's not surprising.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BE)
【Rintaro】Ah whatever. I shall tell you about us in an easy-to-understand way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CE)
【Rintaro】First our current location.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DE)
【Rintaro】This is the Future Gadget Laboratory located in Akihabara Tokyo. We usually just call it "The Lab". We aspire to reconstruct the ruling structure of the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EE)
【Mayuri】Really...? You shouldn't do anything bad Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FE)
【Rintaro】Shut up for a moment Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000040E)
【Rintaro】After leaving the station go down the Central Street until you reach the Suehirochou Station crossing where you take the Kuramaebashi avenue to the left.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041E)
【Rintaro】By entering the alley before the next traffic light you will find an old-fashioned apartment building
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000042E)
【Rintaro】On the first floor of the building we have a certain maniac's shop called the "CRT Workshop".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000043E)
【Rintaro】Even though it's the age of LCD that shop still sells and handles CRT TVs. The demand for those is next to none so the shop is deserted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000044E)
【Rintaro】However Tennouji the manager of the "CRT Workshop" is also the owner of this building.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000045E)
【Rintaro】The urban development is progressing at a quick pace so the price of land in Akihabara has skyrocketed. That's why so many small hobby shops were built here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046E)
【Rintaro】Fortunately the manager has an eye for people. After taking a liking to my charisma he lent me the entire second floor of the building for almost nothing. Fuahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047E)
【Rintaro】
However the Future Gadget Laboratory has a serious lack of capable staff but we are always open to applications from excellent researchers. Currently our researchers are--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000048E)
【Mayuri】Okarin Okarin! You're supposed to say 'Lab Members'! Not researchers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000049E)
【Rintaro】...Lab Members. Including me we make up a grand total of 3.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004AE)
【Rintaro】Laboratory Member No. 001 the lab's founder and crazy mad scientist: myself Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BE)
【Mayuri】Okarin sounds a lot cuter though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D6)
【Rintaro】And then we have Laboratory Member No. 002 the <DICT>cosplay</DICT> hobbyist and the only girl: Shiina Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E6)
【Mayuri】Tuturu! ♪ I'm Mayushii. My hobby is not wearing but making the costumes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FE)
【Rintaro】Finally we have Laboratory Member No. 003 the <DICT>Supa~ Hacka</DICT>, Hashida Itaru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000516)
【Itaru】It's Super Hacker not Supa~ Hacka. <DICT>Duh</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000526)
【Rintaro】Our main activity here at the Future Gadget Laboratory is the act of "invention" itself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000536)
【Rintaro】The details can be found on the lab's homepage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000546)
【Rintaro】Of course our top priority are future gadgets which could be used to fight the dark supremacy but many other inventions were created as byproducts of this research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000556)
【Rintaro】We have already completed 8 future gadgets but that is only the beginning. In my head I have ideas for a total of 108 of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000566)
【Itaru】It's like a certain tennis manga eh? I get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000057E)
【Rintaro】It's the number of humanity's worldly desires you <DICT>@channel</DICT>er.Okarin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000058E)
【Rintaro】Also I told you not to interrupt me while I'm speaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000059E)
【Itaru】Anyway why are you talking to yourself
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005AE)
【Rintaro】I'm not talking to myself! Can't you see? I'm talking to the guy on the other side of the monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005BE)
【Mayuri】Oh he just grinned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005CE)
【Rintaro】What are you laughing about you bastard!? You're the one inside the monitor!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E6)
【Itaru】Maybe you should just tell him to <DICT>"Don't Look This Way"</DICT>
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F6)
【Mayuri】Will he really understand that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000606)
【Rintaro】He doesn't even seem to understand that we're talking to him. His lack of self-awareness is quite sad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000616)
【Mayuri】Maybe to that person we appear to be just a game?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000626)
【Itaru】I don't think that the whole concept of "real" or "game" exists to them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000063E)
【Mayuri】But Daru-kun aren't your beloved <DICT>2D girls</DICT> the same?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000064E)
【Itaru】That's different. They are my waifus.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065E)
【Rintaro】Nobody cares about your wives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066E)
【Itaru】Didn't Mayushii bring up an interesting idea though? Suppose that hypothetically speaking we were the ones inside a game - do you think that it's possible for us to realize that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067E)
【Rintaro】No.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000068E)
【Itaru】An immediate reply huh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000069E)
【Rintaro】That type of discussion is completely unproductive. What we should be focusing on is thinking about how we will crush the world's ruling structure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B8)
【Itaru】<DICT>Pretentious lunatic</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000734)
After what Daru said I look upwards away from the monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000790)
The monitor displayed the disturbing yet cute character "Alpaca-man" whose design was based off of an <DICT>alpaca</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A0)
This is an interactive game called "Alpaca-man 2" where you could speak to it via a microphone and it would answer back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B0)
The game exploded in popularity upon release 10 years ago. Personally I find it only disgusting instead of "disturbing yet cute".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C0)
I bought it yesterday at a second-hand goods store for 500 yen headset included.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000864)
I look back at Daru and squint my eyes to intimidate him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000874)
【Rintaro】Shut up Super Haker. I'm not pretentious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000884)
I raise up my forelocks and collect the right words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000894)
【Rintaro】I'm Hououin... Kyouma!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AE)
【Itaru】What is that an anime character?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BE)
【Rintaro】Good grief. Daru your communication skills are broken beyond repair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D6)
【Itaru】I always liven up the place when I go to anime <DICT>offline</DICT> meetings bro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000974)
This fat eccentric bespectacled guy is my brother-in-arms and right-hand man - Hashida Itaru A.K.A Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000984)
He's one of those otaku youths who sit on the PC all day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000994)
He has 2D wives on who he cheats with 3D maids. There are some problems with his preferences but to him all is well so long as it's moe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A4)
Daru is a very skilled and an extremely reliable man who turns my brilliant ideas into reality despite always saying that his forte is software and not hardware.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A08)
【Mayuri】Ow...! I pricked my finger...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B46)
On the other side we have Shiina Mayuri - a 16 year old high school girl who is currently licking her finger with her eyes full of tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B56)
This one's also an otaku but not nearly as bad as Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B66)
This nonchalant childhood friend of mine is in charge of making anime character cosplay for the Future Gadget Lab. Just like every other day she is doing that right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B76)
I don't really know much about the characters or if the costumes are even good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B86)
Why does the Future Gadget Lab needs (female only) anime character cosplay you ask?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B96)
Let's just say that it absolutely doesn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA6)
That basically means that Mayuri is a completely useless existence to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB6)
However I have absolutely no intention of kicking her out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC6)
After all the first one who knocked on the door of my just-established Future Gadget Lab was no other than her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD6)
Even now I clearly remember the spring day when she first came to the lab. This is what Mayuri said to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C94)
【Mayuri】Mayushii is Okarin's hostage so I will be here no matter what.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1A)
Yes what she meant by that is truly uncertain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2A)
But for me it was an offer of salvation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3A)
She was the first person to join me in my grand plan. Her presence saved me from the solitude of being chased by the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4A)
I will be forever grateful for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5A)
I don't care that Mayuri is useless. I'm fine with her just being here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBE)
【Itaru】So Okarin. Did Alpaca-man respond?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E62)
【Rintaro】No not at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBE)
I don't know if it's a bug but the human-faced Alpaca inside the monitor shows no reaction. What an ungrateful bastard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECE)
Screw this I give up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDE)
This is boring.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEE)
Never again will I play this pointless game.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2E)
【Rintaro】Damn unsociable alpaca...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3E)
While cursing I lightly hit the top of the TV.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4E)
Suddenly...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6A)
【Rintaro】Hm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7A)
The TV made a noise as if it had shorted and then the screen suddenly went pitch black.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8A)
Changing the channel turning the power onoff or hitting it several times didn't change anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA0)
A complete silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB0)
Looks like... It broke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC0)
This shabby TV was given to us for free by the CRT Workshop downstairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD0)
Maybe it's life span is over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001018)
【Mayuri】Alpaca-san must be mad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001028)
【Rintaro】Ugh. I will have to go ask if it can be fixed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001044)
I turn the TV off and go next to the sofa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001054)
The humidity of the Japanese summer is really annoying. While fanning myself I look up at the ceiling where a stain stood out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C0)
I try closing my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D0)
What naturally came to mind was the supernatural sight from an hour ago--
