【Rintaro】Mayuri...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000948)
【Rintaro】...Mayuri?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF4)
No matter how much I call out her name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6E)
Mayuri won't answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE2)
The cemetery.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF2)
Mayuri stands still in front of a grave, gazing at the sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1C)
Buried in that grave is Mayuri's grandmother.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2C)
Mayuri was Granny's little girl since long ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3C)
She was always with her Granny since her parents were always busy with work.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D52)
That Granny died when Mayuri was 11 years old.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D62)
I visited them often when I was little, so that death was very sad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D72)
At the wake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D82)
Though I had thought she'd be crying, Mayuri cried not a single tear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D92)
She was vacantly gazing at her Granny's memorial portrait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA2)
More than half a year later--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB2)
I already advanced to middle school, so Mayuri and I no longer commuted together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
But I'd still go to the cemetary on the way back, and Mayuri would always be standing there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E16)
Mayuri would come to that grave every day, rain or shine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E26)
And then she'd stand still, wordlessly gazing at the sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E36)
As if she could see her Granny in heaven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBC)
In her hands, an old pocket watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECC)
A retro item unbefitting for Mayuri, who looked younger than her peers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDC)
That was her Granny's memento. Mayuri would always hold it when coming to this grave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEC)
【Rintaro】Mayuri?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFC)
No matter how much I call out her name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0C)
Mayuri won't answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1C)
Back then I thought Mayuri had something like aphasia.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2C)
She didn't talk to me. She didn't talk to her parents either. She kept moping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3C)
I would always walk out to that grave and feel something like urgency.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
In the center of the lifeless cemetery, Mayuri would keep endlessly gazing at the sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC6)
Whenever I saw her like that, I thought she might take off and fly to heaven--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD6)
Mayuri was so bravely, and so earnestly looking up at the sky that I seriously thought that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE6)
And so that her Granny wouldn't take Mayuri away with her, I too would come to the cemetery.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
And I'd stand next to the skygazing Mayuri, calling her name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001060)
【Rintaro】Mayuri...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001070)
But, no matter how many times I'd call her, Mayuri wouldn't answer at all. She wouldn't stop looking at the sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001080)
The only sounds resounding in the lonely cemetery were my cries of Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001090)
It was raining that day too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A0)
Mayuri had a light blue umbrella.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C2)
In contrast to the umbrella's color, the sky was glazed gray, covered in clouds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F0)
And after waiting a while, the rain stopped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001100)
Rays of light poured through the gaps in the rain clouds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001110)
Rembrandt lighting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001120)
Alternatively, the phenomenon also known as the Angel Ladder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001130)
Solemn, rays of wondrous light that would make anyone feel the presence of God, regardless of belief.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001140)
And a strong wind blew.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001150)
Mayuri's light blue umbrella fanned out, fluttered, and spun upwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001160)
【Mayuri】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001170)
Mayuri, who had made no motion until then, solely looking up at the sky,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001180)
Without looking at the umbrella,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001190)
Turned to the light falling from the sky,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A0)
And slowly,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B0)
Very slowly,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C0)
Reached out her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D0)
As if to grab onto the invisible ladder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E0)
As if to be pulled up by her Granny.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F0)
Finally, she tiptoed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001200)
Looking from the side, I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001210)
Saw her floating away--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001220)
That's how I felt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001230)
Impulsively, I grabbed Mayuri's outstretched hand, and embraced her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001240)
In retrospect, those were pitiful pretentious hipster bullshit thoughts, but at that time, I felt like Mayuri was really going to vanish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001362)
【Rintaro】I won't let you go anywhere...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001372)
【Rintaro】I won't let you be taken away...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001382)
I realized how embarrassing the words running out of my own mouth were,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001392)
【Rintaro】M-Mayuri is my hostage. My sacrificial live test subject!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A2)
So to hide my embarrasment, I kept continuing the script.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B2)
Right before her Granny died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C2)
Mayuri and I were obsessed with a tokusatsu show on TV.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D2)
I was proud of how well I impersonated the lines of that show's enemy boss, a mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E2)
Once I started saying them, I just couldn't stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F2)
All I could do to hide the embarrassment was to cover it up with even more embarrassing words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001402)
【Rintaro】I-I won't let you run anywhere, okay? Hahah, fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001412)
And when I did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001422)
Mayuri's body shook on my arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001432)
【Mayuri】I see... sniff
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001442)
She whispered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001452)
For the first time in half a year, I heard Mayuri's voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001462)
That voice was wet with tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001472)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's a hostage, isn't she...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001482)
【Mayuri】Then it can't be helped, huh. Ehehe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001492)
She smiled happily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A2)
While dripping tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
Mayuri buried her face in my chest--
