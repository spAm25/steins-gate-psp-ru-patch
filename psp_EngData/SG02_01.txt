A new day dawned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BE)
It's already noon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CE)
The midsummer sun is dazzling after an all nighter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DE)
I don't even want to go outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EE)
But I'm fed up with the humidity in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FE)
I pour Dr Pepper down my throat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000040E)
My stomach's all bubbly. Maybe I drank too fast.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041E)
Because I haven't slept, my grip around the bottle faintly twitches, and my eyes are hazing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000042E)
It feels like my consciousness will fly away if I'm not careful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000043E)
I probably should've at least taken a shower to blow away my drowsiness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000044E)
This building has a simple shower room. It doesn't have a tub, so it's nothing but a shower room. But the difference between having it and not having it is like heaven and hell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004AE)
【Itaru】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004BE)
Daru's operating the computer in a way that puts me right behind his back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CE)
His knees are busily tapping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EA)
The only sounds in the room are the electric fan's rotation and Daru's mouse clicks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FA)
Daru doesn't look this way, nor does he try to talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000522)
I'm the same. We don't have the energy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000532)
By all rights, it's a calm summer afternoon outside, but inside drifts an air of bloodthirst.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000542)
Yesterday--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000552)
That shocking experiment gave me the conviction that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) can function as a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000056E)
Kurisu, not willing to accept the experimental results, nor my conclusion, yelled
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066A)
【Kurisu】Time machines... time machines... are a lie!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C2)
And then she flew out of the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D2)
She never showed her face here again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E2)
Mayuri was downhearted about her karaage and bananas, so she skipped her daily routine of making costumes and went home. She might be holding a grudge over food.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F2)
So, Daru and I are left in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070E)
Our enthusiasm shot through the roof after we learned that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) was hiding such possibilities, and we witnessed a mail sent back into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071E)
So we've been staying up all night doing all sorts of experiments to check if the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is a time machine or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072E)
But the results....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000073E)
We bought various things to throw into the Microwave Ophone (Temp), but they all failed. No change. Nothing happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074E)
After the experiment where the discharge phenomenon occurred, everything warmed up normally without gelification.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075E)
The reason why suddenly nothing happened is unknown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076E)
And about the ability to send mail into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077E)
On top of repeating experiments for now, our current issues are as follows.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000842)
<LINE>
Problem 1--
<LINE>
<LINE>
Discharge phenomenon counter-measures.
<LINE>
Due to the risk of fire, we removed everything flammable from the development room.
<LINE>
We prepared two fire buckets full of water just in case.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000872)
But that's still not a fundamental solution.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000882)
We'll have to observe things in the future, but if things get dangerous, we should consider changing the location of the experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000934)
<LINE>
Problem 2--
<LINE>
<LINE>
The problem of mass increase.
<LINE>
When the discharge phenomenon occurs, the Microwave Ophone (Temp) seems to have a sudden mass increase for unknown reasons.
<LINE>
Because of this, the microwave broke the table and made a dent in the floor.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F2)
To deal with the issue, we placed the microwave on the floor, spreading cushions and blankets under it. It hides the hole in the floor, so it kills two birds with one stone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A02)
It's only a temporary fix, but if we make any more holes in the floor, Mister Braun is quite capable of raising my rent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A12)
That's to say nothing of what disasters it will bring if it falls through the floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A22)
By the way, we need to examine why the mass increases. The question is if a group of amateurs like us can do that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
So with that said, the above two problems are trivial.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5A)
There's a more serious problems at hand. If we don't solve them, we won't be able to send mail into the past. It's that critical a problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0C)
<LINE>
<LINE>
Problem 3--
<LINE>
<LINE>
The conditions to send mail into the past in the first place are unclear.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3C)
No matter how many times we tried, we couldn't specify those conditions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4C)
We stayed up all night repeating trial and error more than 40 times, but not once did the discharge phenomenon reoccur.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B68)
I thought that opening the microwave door was a point, but that line of thought was soon crushed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B78)
There might be some sort of conditions, but for now, we're at a stalemate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B88)
At first, we were in high spirits, but as time progressed, we got more and more frustrated at the experimental failures. And that brings us to the present.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B98)
I've honestly gave up, so I spent the entire morning exhausted like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF2)
My phone received another mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C02)
Since yesterday, they've been sent at random.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C12)
They're all from "Shining Finger"-- the woman named Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C22)
I don't normally use mail that often.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C32)
Unlike high school girls nowadays, like Mayuri, I only send about one a day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C42)
With that said, this frequency is a little irritating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C52)
Since Shining Finger is a mail demon, I should've expected this. I was careless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFE)
Answering it is annoying, so I ignore it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA2)
I chug the Dr Pepper and my stomach starts gurgling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E46)
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEA)
I'm so hungry, I couldn't gather the energy to take a shower.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8E)
I call out to Daru, clattering on the keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001098)
【Rintaro】Hey, wanna go to "Sanbo" for some gyudon?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001174)
【Itaru】Ah~, too much trouble....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001218)
【Rintaro】Aren't you hungry?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012BC)
【Itaru】I am, but-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001372)
【Rintaro】Hmph... you indecisive man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138A)
Anyway, what's he been doing on the computer?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139A)
Interested, I casually peek from behind his shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F6)
Displayed is an image of a futuristic looking facility I've never seen before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001406)
Countless, richly colored cords crawl about a gigantic octagonal tunnel, just like a mandala. Or possibly, the interior of a gigantic space ship from a scifi movie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001416)
It looks more than 10 meters tall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001426)
That's clear from the height of the people pictured with it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001436)
By the way, the people don't look Japanese.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001492)
【Itaru】Hawoo~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A2)
Daru sighs heartily there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
I don't know if the blank look in his eyes are from sleepiness, tiredness, or if something's just wrong with him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C6)
【Itaru】The Large Hadron Collider sure is soothing, huh~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D6)
【Rintaro】Y-you...! What did you just say!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
Large Hadron Collider?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F6)
Is that an incantation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001506)
Or a special move!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001520)
【Itaru】Large Hadron Collider. You don't know about it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F4)
I grab the relaxed Daru's shoulders and wring them out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001604)
【Itaru】Owowowowowow, what are you doing!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001614)
【Rintaro】Are you half asleep?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162E)
【Itaru】No, I'm not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163E)
【Rintaro】What is that Large Hadron Collider thing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001658)
【Itaru】It's SERN's. SERN's. The experimental device of that facility. LHC for short.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001670)
【Itaru】It's seriously moe. <DICT>Recommended</DICT>
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001680)
【Rintaro】You have sexual desires for something not human...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169A)
【Itaru】No. But there's something about it that gets me excited, you know? It makes me smile, you know? Don't you feel that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AA)
【Rintaro】Now that you mention it, just a little earlier, you said that factories and the undersides of highways were irresistible or something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
【Itaru】Yeah, yeah. Those too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CA)
【Rintaro】You lack constancy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016DA)
2D, 3D, and even inanimate objects....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F4)
【Itaru】Isn't it more wasteful to narrow your interests by dividing them into genres?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001704)
Though comparatively, you'd be troubled more with things you're not interested in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001714)
【Rintaro】SERN, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172A)
Let's think about that name again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173A)
You see it everywhere recently. What was it again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174A)
That's a no-brainer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175A)
【Rintaro】John Titor!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001780)
【Itaru】Ahh, John Titor? You mean that guy who's being worshiped on @chan now, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001790)
【Rintaro】That may or may not be an impostor. The John Titor I'm talking about is the one who appeared 10 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AA)
【Itaru】He appeared 10 years ago? The same person?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BA)
My expectations of Daru remembering were crushed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CA)
【Rintaro】Anyway, John Titor touched upon the topic of SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017DA)
I only faintly remember, but one thing is clear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EA)
【Rintaro】Titor left this "prediction". That is, before the year 2034, SERN will complete a time machine...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001804)
【Itaru】Ohh, a time machine. That's a timely topic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181E)
【Itaru】But not just 10 years ago, but methinks the current Titor said the same thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182E)
【Rintaro】10 years ago or now, it doesn't matter. Don't worry about that part, Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183E)
【Rintaro】This strange sign is very likely to be Steins;Gate's choice!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001858)
【Itaru】Can we trust this Titor guy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)
【Rintaro】It doesn't matter if we trust him or not! We are connected to him now my means of the keyword: time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001878)
【Rintaro】There should be no disadvantage to investigating Titor's reference to SERN!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
Energy revives inside of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001898)
Curiosity surely is the greatest delicacy for a mad scientist like me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A8)
Anyway, things are boiling down now, so it doesn't matter if I go out of my way for this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B8)
【Rintaro】Daru, explain SERN to me in detail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D2)
【Itaru】OK. My SERN folder breathes fire.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018EE)
Suddenly triumphant, Daru lightly taps the keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001942)
He goes to the computer's My Pictures folder and opens a folder seriously called SERN. In that folder, Daru has countless SERN-related images collected from all over the web.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001952)
【Itaru】SERN is the world's largest particle physics research institution. It's popularly called the "European laboratory for particle physics".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196E)
【Itaru】It's close to the border of Switzerland and France, at the outskirts of Geneva. It's famous for being the birthplace of <DICT>HTML</DICT> and %B2SHTTP%B2E, %B3SWorld Wide Web%B3E.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A02)
【Rintaro】World Wide Web? As in, the internet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A12)
【Itaru】Bingo. They're the first guys to have a URL.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A22)
That http://www kind of things?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A32)
SERN's the one who invented those things?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A42)
I knew a little about that since I read Titor's book, but for it to be that amazing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AAA)
【Itaru】Japan's not too familiar with it, but Japan's research team is still participating in it too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ABA)
【Rintaro】What sort of research does SERN do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACA)
【Itaru】Fundamentally, particle physics, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADA)
【Itaru】SERN has super huge experimental devices that nobody else in the world does. The so-called particle accelerators.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEA)
【Itaru】The Low Energy Antiproton Ring, the Proton Synchrotron Booster, the Large Electron-Positron Collider.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AFA)
【Itaru】And the last boss is the world's largest, LHC... Large Hadron Collider-tan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0A)
-tan.... Wait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B22)
Otaku stick -tan to the end of words, making it possible to moe <DICT>anthropomorphize</DICT> just about anything in the world. Don't tell me that's it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B32)
Not noticing my amazement, Daru brings the next image up on the monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B42)
【Itaru】Beneath SERN is the LHC, a 27km long circular tunnel established for particle acceleration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B52)
【Itaru】Protons are accelerated and collided in that tunnel, causing unknown elementary particle reactions to occur. They've started these experiments last year.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B62)
【Itaru】Well, before they began to experiment, there were rumors that those experiments could create mini-black holes, though-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B72)
【Itaru】Those mini-black holes will swallow the earth! Oh noes! Space is in danger! Etc.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B82)
Mini-black holes....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B92)
According to posts 10 years ago, Titor's time machine used mini-black holes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA2)
Did his "prediction" concerning SERN come true?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BFE)
【Rintaro】What's the possibility of that actually happening?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C1C)
【Itaru】100％ that it...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C36)
 won't. SERN officially denies it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4A)
【Itaru】Assume mini-black holes are formed. The amount of energy would be extremely small, so the moment they're formed, they disappear. It's impossible for them to swallow the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5A)
【Rintaro】But there's no smoke without fire.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D00)
Titor certainly did say this:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D10)
SERN began time machine research in 2001, and in 2034, they complete the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D20)
Right now, it's 2010. If they actually started that research, that would've been 9 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D30)
According to their official announcement, they began experimenting in 2008. That's suspicious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D40)
Of course, that's assuming the prediction to be true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D50)
Some of Titor's predictions were correct, but several weren't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D60)
I'm also caught in the strangeness of how everyone around me seems to have forgotten about Titor's appearance in 2000.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D70)
There's something about Titor's tale.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D80)
I want there to be something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DFE)
I take out my phone and place it to my right ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E0E)
【Rintaro】It's me. Heheheh, don't be surprised. I sniffed out the scent of an evil conspiracy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E1E)
【Rintaro】...John Titor, and SERN. From those two words, you should understand what I'm trying to say. ...Yeah, that's right. Those guys are very likely related to the "Organization".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E2E)
【Rintaro】Hmph, a coincidence? Hey, come on now, don't disappoint me like that. ...What? Basis? That's right, if I dare say.... it's whispers. My intuition as a mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E3E)
【Rintaro】Those guys are bringing the world to ruin. ...Yeah, through mini-black holes. But, if we were to usurp that technology, what do you think would happen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4E)
【Rintaro】...Heheheh, naturally. Who the hell do you think I am? Everything is Steins;Gate's choice. El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EAE)
When I put away my phone, Daru looks at my face astonished.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F64)
【Itaru】Just who are ya fighting with...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002008)
【Rintaro】Daru, there's only one thing we should do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B6)
【Itaru】One thing? Whuzzat?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000215A)
【Rintaro】Don't you "whuzzat" me! Don't ask again! This is where you consider everything and laugh pleased. Not doing so would be un-supah haka-ly of you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021FE)
I wanted him to say something like whatthefuckever. The reward?.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B28)
【Itaru】Don't be stupid. At least say hacker.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BCC)
【Rintaro】Understand the rest?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C7A)
【Itaru】No, not at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D1E)
【Rintaro】Hack into SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DC2)
Upon hearing my request, Daru makes an astonished face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E70)
【Itaru】...Is that some sort of joke?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F14)
【Rintaro】Daru, I know you can do it. Disclose their dastardly deeds, and procure a hint about the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FCA)
【Itaru】Dastardly deeds...? Okarin, isn't that just your delusion-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FE6)
【Rintaro】We're now at the junction of whether we can use the Microwave Ophone (Temp) as a time machine or whether it will die as garbage in the lab's storage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003000)
【Itaru】You serious?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003010)
【Rintaro】I'm always serious!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003020)
I answer as I stare Daru straight in the eye.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003030)
Thanks to that, it looks like Daru understand how I feel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000304C)
Recklessly brushing off the garbage around his computer, Daru sits up in his chair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000305C)
【Itaru】We don't know how this will turn out, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000306C)
As if his listlessness earlier were a lie, Daru's spine muscles are perfectly stretched out now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000307C)
【Rintaro】The deal is done. Begin at once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000308C)
【Itaru】Uha, let's do this!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000309C)
【Rintaro】I'll deposit your reward of a week's supply of potato chips into your Swiss bank account.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030AC)
【Itaru】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030BC)
Daru's already concentrating so much that he doesn't seem to hear my last remark.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030CC)
【Rintaro】Whelp, I'm sleeping. I leave the rest to you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000313A)
I lie down on the sofa and sink into sleep with the sound of Daru's typing streaming into my ears.
