The blown off, gushy world.

Was instantly reborn.

My body convulses against my will, as if run through with electricity.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085A)
I'm in the lab development room.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086A)
I'm standing in front of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) with my phone to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087A)
No, it's not the Microwave Ophone (Temp). Since headgear is attached to it, it's the Time Leap Machine.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088A)
It's hard to breathe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089A)
I'm almost suffocating.

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AA)
Give me oxygen.

【Rintaro】Ahhh--

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DA)
【Rintaro】......

I stop my voice and start breathing in deeply.

【Rintaro】...ckhaah, haahh, haahh, hah...

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090A)
The insides of my throat feel like they're burning.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091A)
Almost going into a coughing fit, I desperately bring air into my lungs.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000936)
I notice I'm drenched in sweat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000946)
The drops hanging off my forehead is annoying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000956)
I want to wipe it away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000966)
I try wiping it with the back of my right hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000976)
...My right hand moves and wipes the sweat of my forehead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000986)
My body's senses are strange.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000996)
Right now, my body feels one beat off from my will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A6)
As if it's not my own body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B6)
As if my nerves aren't communicating properly with my extremities.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C6)
I try blinking slowly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D6)
It might just be my imagination.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
Am I just tired?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
Since I've been working long nights.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A06)
I timidly try to move my hand again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A16)
It doesn't feel out of place this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A26)
This is my body.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A36)
【Kurisu】Okabe? You listening?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A46)
A familiar voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A56)
I slowly turn around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B30)
There's Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B40)
She gives me perplexed eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5A)
【Kurisu】What happened? You suddenly yelled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6A)
What's she talking about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7A)
【Kurisu】You feeling bad?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9A)
I try answering, but my voice didn't work too well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAA)
Even more bewildered, I clear my throat several times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBA)
【Rintaro】...No, no problems here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD4)
【Kurisu】I see. Then go out and prepare already. You're going shopping, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE4)
【Rintaro】...shopping?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFA)
Shopping? For what...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
I try groping around my memories--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1A)
Like a chain reaction, several scenes, several words, several smells--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2A)
Flash back into my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D28)
【Kurisu】"Humans are temporal beings."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3A)
【Mayuri】He's okay now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118A)
【Kurisu】Are you okay with time leaping!? Are you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001254)
【Rintaro】Ah, ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001264)
I remember--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001274)
I time leaped--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001360)
【Kurisu】You'll remember your memories from the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001422)
remember
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001432)
That's right! What am I lazing around for!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001442)
I--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001452)
【Rintaro】Where is this...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146C)
【Kurisu】Haah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147C)
I grab Kurisu's shoulder and draw near.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014CC)
【Rintaro】What time is it now!? What month? What Day? What time!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
【Kurisu】Hey, ouch...! Calm down...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F6)
【Rintaro】How can I be calm!? Shopping? You told me to go shopping?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001506)
The shopping from when?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DA)
Besides Kurisu, Daru is in the lounge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EA)
He's sitting at his computer, staring here in wonder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FA)
【Rintaro】Daru! What day is today!? What time is it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160A)
【Itaru】Uh, ummm, well, it's the 13th... a little past 5.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161A)
The 13th, past 5....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A8)
【Rintaro】...was it a success...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C6)
During all that chaos, did I successfully time leap?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E4)
Did my memories really jump through time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001702)
So, has my consciousness infected my past memories?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001720)
Or maybe was all of that chaos a dream?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173E)
I mean, that didn't seem real at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175C)
It seemed like something out of a Hollywood movie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177A)
But the sight of Mayuri, bloody and collapsed, is burned into my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001798)
And the smell of blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B6)
And the memory of a gunshot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D4)
And the sensation of headgear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F2)
And the pain of getting shot in the arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001810)
And Kurisu's screams. And Suzuha's vivid agility.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182E)
I clearly remember the chain of events.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000184C)
I try touching my arm and my right ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186A)
No wounds. Nor pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
Was that all a dream?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A6)
I don't know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C4)
I've never time leaped before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E2)
Or should I say, I can't help but hope it was a dream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001900)
Such a future... is too much...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191E)
I'm about to cry when I recall Mayuri's last moments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193C)
I strongly hold it back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195A)
【Rintaro】...Where's Mayuri?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A1A)
I look about the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A38)
Kurisu and Daru are here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A56)
But I can't find Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A74)
【Rintaro】Where is Mayuri!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A92)
【Itaru】Where? Didn't she just say she was going to Luka-shi's place? Okarin, didn't you hear?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB0)
Right, Mayuri finished making Lukako's costume and told us she went off to persuade her. Basically, Mayuri won't come back until the party.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACE)
What do I do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEC)
What do I believe?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0A)
That it was a dream?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B28)
Or that I time leaped?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B46)
If it were a dream, then I don't have to worry about anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B64)
If I time leaped, then I need to start acting immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B82)
I--
