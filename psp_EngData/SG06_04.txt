It was exactly the same.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A82)
Several black shadows break into the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A92)
With movements all too quick.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA2)
With sharpness all too trained.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB2)
And with pointed guns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC2)
About five men had broken in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD2)
I recognize all of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE2)
Now I'm convinced.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF2)
I had time leaped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B02)
Kurisu had pushed me to change this ridiculous present.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B12)
And yet I thought it was a dream, and ruined my chance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B22)
【Rounder A】Don't move. Everyone, hands in the air.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B38)
Silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B48)
Standstill.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B58)
The intruders say no more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B68)
I regret my actions these past few hours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B78)
Why didn't I do anything?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B88)
What did I time leap for?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B98)
The sound of heels echoes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA8)
A woman is coming up the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB8)
It's Kiryuu Moeka...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC8)
The woman who killed-- no, who will kill Mayuri, is coming.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFE)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0E)
Everything's the same as my dream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1E)
That was reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2E)
That was my future memory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3E)
That was what awaited in the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4E)
【Mayuri】Moeka-san? This is...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5E)
【Moeka】We're taking the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6E)
If I kill her first, will that mean Mayuri won't die?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7E)
I considered the option, but soon gave up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8E)
The gunmen are more troublesome than Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9E)
One of them even has an AK-47.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAE)
The instant I resist, he'll make beehives outta us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBE)
If only Suzuha would come back a little quicker...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCE)
That's my wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDE)
【Moeka】Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEE)
【Moeka】No resistance permitted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFE)
【Moeka】Anyway, come.

【Rintaro】......

【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3E)
No words.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4E)
【Kurisu】I'd like to at least know the reason and destination...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5E)
【Moeka】Resistance is futile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6E)
【Moeka】You have nowhere to run.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7E)
【Moeka】My comrades are already spread throughout Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8E)
【Moeka】I don't want to resort to violence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9E)
【Moeka】The three of you, come with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAE)
【Kurisu】Why three?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBE)
【Moeka】I have no intention of answering any questions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCE)
【Moeka】All you people have to do is come with me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDE)
【Mayuri】H-hey, Moeka-san, you're a fellow lab mem... aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEA)
Moeka answers that question--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB8)
By pulling a gun out of her shirt and readying it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC8)
The same--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD8)
【Moeka】The reason we're having you come with us--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE8)
【Moeka】Is to silence you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF8)
【Moeka】That won't change even if you refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001008)
【Moeka】The three of you, come with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001018)
【Moeka】If you refuse any more, we'll make you want to come with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001028)
Moeka slowly raises her gun hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001038)
Its muzzle points directly at--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001138)
【Mayuri】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001148)
【Moeka】Shiina Mayuri is unnecessary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001158)
I try to stop it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001168)
But my hoarse voice won't come out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001178)
I just looked stupid, spewing out air.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001188)
Seeking help, I look at Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001198)
Kurisu's looking at Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A8)
She has a tearful face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B8)
I look at Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C8)
He's trembling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D8)
He's trying to mutter something, but his voice won't come out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E8)
Someone, stop this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127C)
Stop Moeka...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133A)
【Moeka】...for SERN... for FB... for SERN... FB...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001354)
Her lips close tightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001406)
With a dry sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001416)
Everything moves in slow motion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001426)
The passage of time slows down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147E)
Moeka's gun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F0)
She pulls the trigger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EE)
Bam. Blood flutters from Mayuri's forehead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FE)
Warm liquid splashes onto my face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160E)
I hurriedly catch Mayuri's delicate, small body as it starts to collapse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166E)
Mayuri's body was like a marionette with its strings cut.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167E)
Her head and her limbs drooped, powerless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168E)
My nose is assaulted by the smell of gunpowder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169E)
And then, the smell of blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001714)
【Itaru】Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001730)
Daru screams while holding his head, falling to his knees on the spot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001740)
In my arms.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001750)
Mayuri breathes her dying breaths--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001760)
【Mayuri】O...kari...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001770)
【Mayuri】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178A)
【Kurisu】No, noooo...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183C)
Died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000184C)
Mayuri died again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AC)
Mayuri's face was stained red.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BC)
That stain soaks into my hands too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CC)
Very warm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018DC)
Mayuri's body moves not a twitch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018EC)
【Moeka】I'll say it once more. The three of you, come with us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018FC)
【Moeka】You have no more warnings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190C)
【Moeka】If you resist, we will kill you too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191C)
It reaches my ears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192C)
I hear that voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193C)
But I don't hear those words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194C)
The same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195C)
I understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196C)
I let Mayuri die again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197C)
Because I didn't try to believe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198C)
I lay Mayuri down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199C)
I'm sorry, Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AC)
I'm sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B1C)
I stand up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2C)
Even though this is the second time, I'm overcome with hatred for Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B3C)
I try to plop down and barrel roll to approach Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C18)
【Kurisu】Okabe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C28)
She grabs my arm from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C38)
【Kurisu】You can't...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C48)
【Rintaro】Let me go!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C58)
【Kurisu】You can't, you can't... they'll kill you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD4)
Moeka's gun is now pointed to my brow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE4)
Her finger is already on the trigger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF4)
【Rintaro】You gonna kill me too!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D04)
【Moeka】If you resist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D14)
【Kurisu】Okabe, please, for now, just obey... okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D24)
【Kurisu】At this rate, they'll kill you too...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D34)
【Rintaro】Gh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D44)
I strongly grind my teeth and hold back my rage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D54)
I see a small shadow soar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D64)
It strikes Moeka's gun hand--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002082)
【Moeka】...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002138)
Moeka drops her gun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002148)
At her feet, a small stone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002158)
【Suzuha】Get down!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002174)
【Attacker B】Gweh!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
Appearing with the exact same timing as before I time leaped, Suzuha knocks down the attacker standing close to the entrance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021F8)
And then her sharp movements seamlessly flow, knocking down a second and third.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002208)
【Rounder A】Why that...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002218)
The remaining dark skinned crew cut guy tries to shoot his automatic rifle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002228)
But before he can, Suzuha snatches a stunned attackers gun and shoots him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002244)
【Rounder A】Gwah!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
Blood spurts out of the man's hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002276)
Without stopping, Suzuha delivers a soaring soccer ball kick to the squatting crew cut guy's jaw.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002292)
【Moeka】That's enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000235A)
【Suzuha】!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000236A)
Moeka and Suzuha point their guns at each other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000237A)
A staredown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000238A)
Silence returns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000239A)
【Moeka】...who are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023AA)
【Suzuha】42
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023BA)
Suzuha murmurs a cryptic number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023CA)
She glances at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023DA)
【Suzuha】TV
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023EA)
No, I already know what she means.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023FA)
【Suzuha】Turned on
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000240A)
I jump into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C2)
【Moeka】Don't move!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D2)
【Suzuha】That's my line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000251A)
I bring Kurisu along.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000252A)
I put on the headgear without hesitation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000253A)
【Kurisu】Okabe, I--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000254A)
【Rintaro】I'm leaping...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000255A)
【Kurisu】But! What if it fails--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000256A)
【Rintaro】Please set it up!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257A)
I order Kurisu around and pick up Monad Snake from the side shelf.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002596)
Kurisu bites her lip and starts putting the settings into the X68000.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025A6)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro! One guy's moving!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025B6)
【Moeka】Kill them, don't let them use it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C6)
Before the crew cut man enters the development room, I push the switch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026BA)
My vision turns white.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026CA)
I can't see anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026DA)
I can't tell anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002722)
【Kurisu】Okabe! Is this really okay!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000273C)
【Kurisu】Are you okay with time leaping!? Are you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274C)
【Rintaro】Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002946)
After that, beyond the smoke. Bluish-white light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002956)
The discharge phenomenon is starting!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002966)
The bluish-white light grows more extreme.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002976)
My feet shake intensively.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002986)
The ring singularity opens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D2)
I push down the headgear with one hand and crouch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AF8)
This is reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B08)
It wasn't a dream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B18)
I engrave that fact into my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B28)
Once more--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B7E)
Tremendous shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B9A)
【Rintaro】Please, let me leap once more!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BAA)
Right after my shout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BBA)
Once again, the world blows away--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E20)
TL02.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000316A)
My eardrums feel like they're blown away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000317A)
My sense of hearing goes numb.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000318A)
【Rintaro】--!!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000319A)
The blown off, gushy world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031AA)
Was instantly reborn.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031BA)
My body convulses against my will, as if run through with electricity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031CA)
--I come back to my senses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031E6)
I'm in the lab development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031F6)
I'm standing in front of the Time Leap Machine with my phone to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003206)
【Rintaro】...Gh
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003216)
My brain hurts again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003226)
It's different from a headache.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003236)
Not only pain, but various feelings overflow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003246)
Miserable feelings, tearful sadness, excessive laughter--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003256)
Almost as if weren't myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003266)
But. Even so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003276)
【Rintaro】...I leapt again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003286)
I fumble at that fact.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003296)
I quickly return to the lounge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000336A)
【Kurisu】Kyah, you surprised me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000337A)
I almost crashed into Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003394)
【Kurisu】Don't startle me like that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003468)
【Rintaro】Daru...! Is it the before 5 on the 13th!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003482)
【Itaru】Eh, umm, yeah, it is, so...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003566)
Alright. Time leap successful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003576)
I pat Kurisu on the shoulders, almost in an embrace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003586)
【Rintaro】You're... a genius...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035A0)
【Kurisu】Wha, what's this so suddenly? Feels bad man...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035CA)
I hurriedly take out my phone.
