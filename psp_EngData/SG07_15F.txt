The warmth of Faris' hand suddenly disappeared from mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001F8)
【Rintaro】Wha...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000214)
The summer sun fills my disoriented vision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000224)
Next comes the noise of Akiba to fill my ears: crowd commotion and electronic shop theme songs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000234)
【Rintaro】This is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000244)
Sudden teleportation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000254)
I realized I was standing at Chuo Dori. Animate is in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000264)
...animate!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000274)
I checked my surroundings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000284)
【Rintaro】All the moe shops... are coming back...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000294)
The world line must have changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A4)
That was clear from the occurrence of Reading Steiner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B4)
Faris is nowhere to be seen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C4)
Just until now, we were standing right next to each other, holding hands, yet she vanished.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D4)
Did her very existence also disappear?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E4)
No freaking way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F4)
I refuse to accept that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000304)
Did my fortune turn out good or bad?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000314)
For now, I should examine this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000444)
When I visit the Tennouji residence, Tennouji Nae is there watching the house by herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000454)
I ask her the big favor of letting me inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000464)
There, the Divergence Meter was in good shape.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B0)
What's up... with this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C0)
The first digit is blank.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D0)
It now reads .27349％.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E0)
Is it broken? Or is there some sort of reason?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004F0)
Anyway, better make a note of this number on my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000500)
After I tore apart our memories with Suzuha, I checked to make sure that the numbers were all above 0.4％, so that means it went pretty low.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000510)
But the biggest question is that missing 0.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000564)
【Nae】Um... who, who are you? What do you need from us?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000574)
Nae tries to hide herself behind the sliding door, firmly peering at what I'm doing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000584)
She's leaking an even bigger aura of fear than usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000594)
I feel like I need to calm her down somehow or else she'll tattle on me to the manager later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A4)
【Rintaro】Sorry for the sudden intrusion. But I'm done here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B4)
【Rintaro】By the way, your old man showed me the way here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C4)
Even after I tell her my excuse, she still looks like she's about to cry, and she still doesn't come any closer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D4)
【Nae】Who... are you? Please, get out already... If you don't, I'll call the police. And my daddy's really, really strong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E4)
【Rintaro】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F4)
What is this eerie feeling?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000604)
【Rintaro】What do you mean, "Who are you?" How mean. We see each other occasionally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000061E)
【Nae】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000062E)
【Rintaro】I rent out the second floor of your old man's shop, right? Did you forget?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000648)
【Nae】D, Daddy, save me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000658)
【Rintaro】Nononono... wait a sec.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000668)
【Nae】If you do bad things to me, I'll bite off my tongue and die...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000678)
【Rintaro】Look, I won't, okay? More importantly, do you really not remember who I am?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000692)
Nae frantically shakes her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A2)
【Rintaro】So, we've never met?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B2)
Now she nods deeply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C2)
【Rintaro】...I'm... sorry about that. I know your old man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D2)
【Rintaro】I'm done here, so I'll just leave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E2)
Frantically forcing a smile to hide my confusion-- my innermost thoughts were terribly disturbed-- I leave the Tennouji residence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000800)
This is what I think of my situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000810)
This is what I convinced myself on the way back to Akiba Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000820)
I think a 0.2％ change is quite large.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000830)
When I sacrificed Suzuha's memories, it only changed 0.07％, and I thought that was a dramatic change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000840)
It's not strange for there to be a large change in relationships.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000850)
I probably don't know the majority of what events happened in the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000860)
And besides that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000870)
...With the sole exception of Faris, all contacts have been cleared from my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000880)
To me, that was nothing but pure horror.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000890)
To save Mayuri and Faris' dad, we made a past-changing wager. To have lost the existence of everyone in that wager except Faris is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A0)
--Unbearable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B0)
No, that can't be true. There's no way everyone got annihilated. I'm sure they still exist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C0)
My phone's just broken is all. Yeah, that's probably it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D0)
Inside of me, a contradiction is born.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E0)
This is what I think of my situation. Obviously, my circumstances have greatly changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F0)
But I don't want my relationships with the lab members to have changed in the slightest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000900)
I keep chanting this desire in my head like a whining child.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A0)
Mayuri, Daru, or Kurisu should normally be in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B0)
Once I get in, Mayuri should cheerily greet me, and the other two should greet me lazily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C0)
I climb the stairs to the second floor wishing just that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D0)
But then I realized how optimistic I had been.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E0)
The second floor had become a vacant room--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F0)
And obviously, the Time Leap Machine was nowhere to be found.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B14)
【Rintaro】So MayQueen... exists now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B24)
I came to this shop first in my quest to find traces of the people I know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B34)
It feels like it's been forever since I've seen that cat logo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B44)
I take a gulp of air to catch my breath, and open the store door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BAC)
【Mayuri&Faris (M)】Welcome homeow, Master♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBC)
【Mayuri&Faris (F)】Welcome homeow, Master♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
【Rintaro】Faris, Mayuri...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE0)
【Rintaro】Thank god...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF0)
I feel relieved from the bottom of my heart seeing these two greet me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C00)
These two didn't disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C10)
They both work at this store exactly as I had remembered they did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDE)
【Mayuri】No, Master-. I'm actually Mayushii NyanNyan♪.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEE)
Mayuri smiles at me while striking a catlike pose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D08)
【Mayuri】You're Faris-chan's Duel Partner, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D18)
She says that and turns around to Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3E)
【Mayuri】Faris-chan, by any chance, did you tell this guy Mayushii's real name?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D58)
【Faris】Hmmya? I don't remyember telling him~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D72)
【Faris】But I myean, you do call yourself Mayushii, so he just somehow guessed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8C)
【Mayuri】Oh, I see-. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9C)
【Rintaro】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAC)
That eerie feeling again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFC)
【Faris】Kyouma, Kyouma,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0C)
I lend Faris my ear when she calls me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E26)
【Faris】Thanks for coming for meow. But I don't want you to act too boyfriendly in front of all the customers. Understand meow?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E36)
【Rintaro】Boyfriend...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E50)
【Faris】Dummy! You can't say that, nya~! We can sweet talk all we want after work's over, so hold out until then, okay, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E60)
【Rintaro】What are you talking about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E7A)
【Faris】Nyanya? Hmm, so that's how it is nya. So you understood from the start, nya. That's Kyouma for you. Gets the job done quick, nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E94)
【Mayuri】C'mon, Faris-chan, you shouldn't flirt in the store-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EAE)
【Faris】Nyahaha. What do you mean, Mayushii? I did nyo such thing, nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBE)
【Rintaro】More importantly, Mayuri, do you know Daru or Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED8)
【Mayuri】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE8)
Mayuri tilts her head with a dubious look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF8)
【Mayuri】Daru? Chris? Who could they be-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
...That eerie feeling wasn't my imagination.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F18)
Mayuri and Faris's words were weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F28)
In other words, my relationship with these two has also been delicately changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F38)
【Rintaro】Where's our laboratory?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F48)
【Mayuri】Laboratory?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F62)
【Faris】Lavatory!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F72)
What the hell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8C)
Faris quickly pulls me by the ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9C)
【Rintaro】Ow, owow, what're you doing!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
【Faris】Kyoumaa. What's this about, nya? Don't tell meow you made plans to meet Mayuri in the lavatory?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBC)
【Faris】Kyouma's such a pervert to do such immeowral things even though he's a minor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCC)
【Rintaro】Laboratory, not lavatory, drills-for-brains! Don't mix them up!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE6)
【Faris】Laboratory? What do you mean by laboratory, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF6)
【Rintaro】Laboratory, as in, the Future Gadget Research Lab...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001006)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, you know, don't you? About the Future Gadget Research Lab!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001020)
【Mayuri】Hmmm, Mayushii doesn't really know. Sorry-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001030)
She doesn't know... no way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104A)
【Faris】Anyway, why have you only been talking to Mayushii neow? You flirting right in front of your girlfriend, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106A)
Girlfriend. Faris is? Whose?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107A)
...Mine!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108A)
【Faris】I'll have to ask that kind of Master to go home, nya. So what'll you do, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109A)
【Rintaro】Ah, ahh, sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AA)
I obediently apologize and ask to be seated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010BA)
And inside, at a table for two, sits Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001196)
His large body is shaking bit by bit. On closer look, he's fidgeting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A6)
Moreover, why is he staring at me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B6)
【Rintaro】Daru, so this is where you were.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C6)
I sit in front of Daru and take a breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D6)
I drink up my water in one gulp, quenching my thirst.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E6)
Daru doesn't try to hide his displeasure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F6)
【Itaru】You, what are you to Faris-tan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001206)
【Rintaro】What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001228)
【Itaru】I've seen your face somewhere. Well, whatever. You're being way too familiar with Faris-tan. A little cocky, are we? A <DICT>normalfag</DICT>? You're a normalfag, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001238)
【Rintaro】Woah, Daru. Just what are you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001248)
I start talking, but then shut up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001258)
If we take Mayuri and Faris for example, it's entirely possible that my relationship with Daru changed too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
I try to ask in a roundabout way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001278)
【Rintaro】Is this our first meeting?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001292)
【Itaru】Duh. This is your first time to this store, isn't it? As a regular customer here, I make sure to check other customers' faces.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A2)
【Rintaro】No, I'm pretty sure I come here enough, but--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B2)
【Itaru】This taste... is the taste of a liar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C2)
【Rintaro】How can you tell without even licking me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DC)
【Itaru】Annnyway, answer me. What are you to Faris-tan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EC)
【Rintaro】I'm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012FC)
【Itaru】Should I ask more specifically? Well then, Question One~ What- is your name?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130C)
Why do I have to be cross-examined by Daru?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131C)
It's unpleasant, but I also don't want to anger him any more, so I'll answer him honestly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132C)
Well, the problem is which name to call myself...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133C)
【Rintaro】Ho, Hououin Kyouma...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001356)
【Itaru】Seriously!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001366)
Suddenly, Daru bends himself forward.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001376)
He did a complete 180 and grabbed my hand with his eyes shining, making his previous displeasure seem like an act.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001390)
【Itaru】Ahh, that's it, that's it. Yeah, yeah. That's right. Right on. I was sure I'd seen you before-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A0)
【Itaru】You're Faris-tan's Duel Partner, Hououin-shi! Wow, how thoughtless of me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B0)
【Itaru】It's an honor to meet you! I'm a big Faris-tan and Hououin-shi fan! I saw that last semifinal!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C0)
He forcibly shakes my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D0)
Daru's hand is all damp and sweaty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E0)
【Rintaro】Eh... hey, wait, Daru...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FA)
【Itaru】Daru? How do you know my nickname?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140A)
【Rintaro】Ah, well...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141A)
I finally catch on to my situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142A)
If I assume that the lab is no more, that should explain a dozen things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000143A)
Mayuri and Daru don't know about me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000144A)
We haven't met.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145A)
We're not childhood friends.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146A)
We're not partners.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147A)
【Rintaro】I... see...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000148A)
Our memories disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000149A)
So is that... the outcome of the bet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014AA)
Is it my fate to live in this cruel mockery...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C4)
【Itaru】Man, tomorrow's the long awaited finals, huh! Beat the shit out of those "Viral Attackers" for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D4)
【Rintaro】Finals...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E4)
The name Viral Attackers means that it's about RaiNet Access Battlers, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F4)
So does that mean that I'm partnering up with Faris and participating?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001504)
But the finals should have finished yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001514)
But in this world line, it's tomorrow?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001524)
Let's confirm this with Faris later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001534)
Somehow or another, it looks like I'm her partner in both love and war.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001544)
But more importantly, there's one other thing I need to check.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001554)
【Rintaro】Hey, do you... know someone called Makise Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001564)
【Itaru】Ahh, eh, yeah, yeah, if I'm not mistaken, she's that genius girl whose thesis got published in that big academic journal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001574)
【Rintaro】Have you met her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001584)
【Itaru】She had a lecture before at ATF. I listened to it. She was quite the looker, oohehe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159E)
【Itaru】So, what about her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AE)
【Rintaro】No, nothing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CA)
If the lab doesn't exist, then isn't it obvious he hasn't met with Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DA)
I go limp in my chair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EA)
Did I win the bet? Did I lose the bet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FA)
I should know by tonight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160A)
If things go as scheduled, Mayuri will die tonight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161A)
Did our deep revision to the world line come out with good or bad fortune?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162A)
And also, is Faris' father still alive?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163A)
If both are saved, then I can accept the vanishing of our memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164A)
All I can do is accept it...
<FILEEND28>
