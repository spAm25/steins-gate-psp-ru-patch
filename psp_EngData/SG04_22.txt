#WRITE(PTR, $000008E2)
I somehow manage to calm down, and come back to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F2)
For now, I'll think of that mail as a prank and drive it to the corner of my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000968)
Gathered in the lab this early in the morning-- well, actually it's already noon-- are three high school girls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000978)
Lab Mem Numbers 002, 004, and 006.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000988)
Mayuri, Kurisu, and Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000998)
I greet them, trying not to stiffen my expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A8)
【Rintaro】It's Sunday on Obon holiday. You've sure got some free time, eh, Lab Mem Girls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3E)
【Luka】Ah, Okabe-san. Pardon the intrusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A86)
【Mayuri】Okarin, good morning-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A96)
I smile and wave back at the two high school girls for my morning greeting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA6)
In a sense, this is a happy scene.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB6)
By the way, one of these girls is, to be accurate, a high school boy who looks like a girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC6)
And that happy scene was ruined by a certain assistant who just gave me an uninterested look before going back to reading.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD6)
【Rintaro】What are you doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3A)
Mayuri and Lukako are sitting next to each other on the sofa, reading a book together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4A)
When I take a peek, it looks like a cosplay photoalbum.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5A)
【Mayuri】You know, yesterday I said I was going to Nakano to by doujinshi, right-? And when I was there, I found a doujin photoalbum of a super cute cosplayer-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6A)
【Mayuri】So I bought it on impulse♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B82)
【Mayuri】Look, Luka-chan. This is a costume of Sedona from <DICT>Blood Tune</DICT>. Isn't it well made-? Isn't it super cute-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B92)
【Luka】Wahh, it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA2)
I see. And so she's showing it to Lukako to reeducate him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB2)
Lukako was so against it, but Mayuri's pretty praiseworthy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC2)
But he looks so interested in the photoalbum, that maybe he's interested in cosplay itself. Maybe his issue is simply being too shy to be in front of people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD2)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, Chris-chan, take a look too-. It's impressive-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE2)
【Kurisu】It's okay, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF2)
Looks like Kurisu's the only one not participating in the doujin photoalbum appreciation party.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C02)
She just gives a cold hmph.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C12)
She's reading a difficult western book.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C22)
Dammit, pretending to be intelligent?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C32)
You don't talk that way when Mayuri gives you a suggestion. Or so I thought, but Mayuri doesn't seem to mind, so I don't butt in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C42)
【Mayuri】Wah, the next pages are swimsuits-. Amazing-. So much skin, huh. She's got great style, like a gravure idol.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C52)
【Luka】How admirable...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C62)
【Mayuri】Admirable-? The swimsuits?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C72)
【Luka】I... don't have that great a style...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C82)
【Mayuri】But but, Luka-chan, I'm sure you make your large friends breathe hard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C92)
Hey, hey, Mayuri... What the hell are you saying? It's like you're referring to Daru with that remark.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA2)
【Mayuri】You know, flat chests are justice. So even if you don't have breasts, you should still be confident-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB2)
【Kurisu】Khmmkhmmkhmm!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC2)
Kurisu starts magnificently choking on her coffee.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD2)
I know that feel. I almost did a spittake with my Dr Pepper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE2)
Furthermore, Mayuri has no persuasive power at all with her super bust unsuitable for her height.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3E)
【Mayuri】I know. Once ComiMa's over, let's all go play in the ocean-. It's summer after all, and Mayushii's been making costumes all the time, so she hasn't gotten to play at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D58)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, Okarin, Chris-chan, whaddya think-? An all-lab mem beach trip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA0)
【Luka】Eh...? All lab mems...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE8)
【Kurisu】I'm not going. I've gotta go back to America soon. I haven't even packed, so I don't have that much time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
【Rintaro】Well, since you're casually reading in the lab, you seem to have plenty of time to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E20)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E30)
Kurisu snaps her book shut and glares at me for my sarcasm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4A)
【Kurisu】Fine, then I'll be blunt. Why the hell would I go swimming with two perv scoundrels?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E64)
【Kurisu】If it's just the girl members, I'd happily join♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E74)
【Rintaro】Hmph, so you're being honest now, Christina. "I don't want to show the boys my birthmarked butt, so I don't want them to come"-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8E)
【Kurisu】I don't have a birthmark!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9E)
【Rintaro】Anyway, if you're limiting it to just the girl members, then doesn't that rule out Lukako?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB8)
【Kurisu】What the hell do you mean by that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC8)
【Rintaro】Didn't we expressly tell you before? That Lukako is a bonafide man!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F16)
My declaration of the truth--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F26)
Freezes the atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F36)
Wait, what...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F46)
There's something off about their reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9A)
【Kurisu】You're the worst. I can't believe you'd call a girl a man right in front of her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001010)
【Mayuri】That's right. Okarin, I don't like you saying that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001020)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001030)
Not just Kurisu, but even Mayuri condemns me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001040)
And then Lukako starts to clearly turn pale, hanging his head with shaking shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
Is he... crying...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001060)
Normally, he'd get depressed and say something like That's true, I am a guy... and wearing swimsuits is embarrassing too, but he'd never start crying...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001070)
【Rintaro】Christina. I understand your desire to turn a blind eye to the truth. After all, Lukako is a guy, yet he is so lovely--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001152)
【Kurisu】Okabe!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001162)
Kurisu's expression grows ever more stern as she approaches me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117C)
【Kurisu】If giving me weird nicknames is your sense of humor, then that's fine-- no, actually it's not fine at all--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118C)
【Kurisu】But what you said just now is below the belt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A6)
【Kurisu】I didn't think you were the sort of jerk to hurt others, but I was mistaken, wasn't I? Right now, you're really the worst.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B6)
【Rintaro】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C6)
What? Why did disaster suddenly strike?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011E0)
【Kurisu】Apologize. Apologize to Urushibara-san right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F0)
【Rintaro】No, no, wait. I don't have to apologize for anything. I just said the tru--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001200)
【Luka】It's okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001248)
Lukako gets up from the sofa, whispering with a fading voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001258)
Still hanging his head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
【Luka】So... so that's how Okabe-san sees me, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001278)
【Rintaro】Nonononono! That's not how I see you, Lukako, you -are- a guy, right!? Or are you escaping from reality too!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001292)
【Kurisu】You're the one escaping from reality!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DA)
【Mayuri】That's right-. Luka-chan's a girl. Okarin, you're terrible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EA)
【Rintaro】Anyway, Mayuri, why did you suddenly start calling Lukako "Luka-chan" instead of "Luka-kun"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012FA)
【Kurisu】Okabe, how long are you gonna keep this up!? She's a girl!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130A)
Mayuri nods in agreement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131A)
Eh, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132A)
Just what are these guys...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133A)
A prank? A trap?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000134A)
【Luka】I'm... going home...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C0)
And then Lukako slips by me, trying to head outside the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D0)
I grab his hand from behind and detain him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E0)
【Rintaro】Hold it, Lukako! Stop trying to trick me! You are an honest to goodness man! If you want proof, it's right here--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000143C)
I put Lukako's slender body into a Nelson hold.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000144C)
I try to grab at Lukako's "manhood" at his crotch--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001552)
Nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001562)
【Rintaro】Oh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001572)
【Luka】Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001582)
【Kurisu】You...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001592)
【Mayuri】Awawa....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168A)
【Rintaro】Ohhhh? Eh? Huh? Why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169A)
I try groping at his crotch some more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AA)
【Luka】ugh, No, no, don't... Okabe-san, please... stop... sniff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
Nothing. Nada.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CA)
It should be there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016DA)
I mean, he's a man--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016EA)
At that moment, an electric current runs through my brain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016FA)
No way--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170A)
Yes way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171A)
So is that how it is...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
【Rintaro】Lukako, you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
That D-mail that I thought was surely a failure...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
Was a success...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B2)
【Rintaro】You're a girl!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FA)
【Kurisu】That's what we've been saying-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAE)
Immediately afterward, my brain gets thumped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BBE)
The corner of Kurisu's massive book sinks into my skull--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C88)
【Luka】hic... ugg... egh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
Lukako is crying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA8)
Mayuri worriedly rubs her back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF8)
Kurisu glares down at me in a daunting stance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D08)
Daru, who arrived a moment ago, is in the corner, stifling a laugh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D18)
"How rude" is what I'd like to say, but don't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D28)
Because 100 out of 100 unknowing outsiders would assume the situation is like this:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D38)
A perverted college boy is genuflecting to a high school girl of justice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D48)
And that assumption isn't technically incorrect...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D58)
The top of my head is throbbing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D68)
Most likely because Kurisu instantly wiped out a hundred million of my environmentally endangered neurons in a single blow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D78)
I put a moist towel to my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D88)
【Kurisu】I want to vivisect your brain out of your head and give it a good washing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA2)
【Kurisu】Then, without putting it back in your body, I'd submerge it in culture fluid so you couldn't do another shameful act like that again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DBC)
【Kurisu】Anyway, I won't hand you over to the police, so consider thanking me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DCC)
【Rintaro】Yes ma'am... I'm sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DDC)
I honestly apologize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF8)
No, I was too hasty....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E08)
I didn't think it'd be gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F0E)
Lukako became a woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F1E)
Her appearance didn't change, and she's a flat-chested girl, but still a girl nonetheless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F2E)
After all, that which is precious is gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F3E)
I clearly confirmed that by my own hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F4E)
It's now the firm truth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F5E)
Who would've thought we'd prove that idiotic old wives' tale in this fashion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6E)
More importantly, I did something horrible to Lukako...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F86)
It wouldn't be strange if the perverted act of groping such an innocent 17 year old girl's crotch would give her <DICT>PTSD</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F96)
And that's to say nothing of Lukako's already docile nature...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA6)
Next time I come in contact with her, I need to be as gentle as humanly possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB6)
No, maybe I shouldn't even speak to her for as long as life endures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC6)
But I'm entirely at fault, so I have to accept any stigma placed upon me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002080)
【Kurisu】Anyway, just what would give you such a strange delusion like Urushibara-san being a boy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002090)
【Rintaro】Heheheh... I said so before, didn't I? The past changed via D-mail. Lukako was a guy, but we sent his wish to become a girl as a D-mail. And we succeeded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A0)
【Rintaro】The instant the world line changed, I certainly recognized it did. By means of the demon eye, Reading Steiner, of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B0)
【Rintaro】I ought to look at that time in retrospect. I should've had more faith in my own special ability!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C0)
Kurisu calmly readies her book above her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DA)
【Kurisu】Want some more?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B0)
【Rintaro】No, it's true. Please believe me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021C0)
【Rintaro】I can theoretically explain this phenomenon. When we sent the D-mail, the world's history changed to follow suit. Basically, the past changed. My brain perceived that change!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021D0)
【Rintaro】I, alone throughout the whole world, can perceive causality changes! Correct, that means that I am this world's observer!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021E0)
I stand up in excitation, bellowing out a fervent speech.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021F0)
But nobody gave any reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002210)
【Kurisu】Just sit down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E6)
I sit down again in dejection.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022FE)
【Rintaro】I'm the observer. In other words, the person who opens the box in the so-called "<DICT>Schrodinger's cat</DICT>" experiment in quantum mechanics.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002346)
【Mayuri】Shredding Gar-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000238E)
【Itaru】Wahh, he said it, Schrodinger's cat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000239E)
【Itaru】The Japanese have a Schrodinger fetish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B8)
【Kurisu】You're Japanese too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D0)
【Itaru】I'm already sick of it. I do admit that <DICT>pussies</DICT> are cute, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E0)
【Rintaro】Gh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F0)
Daru struck the nail on the head so well, I can't object.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002400)
Schrodinger's experiment certainly has become a staple of Japanese entertainment media dealing with quantum theory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242A)
【Rintaro】Anyway, I have a demon eye with such a unique ability. Its name is Reading Steiner, as I have explained before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002444)
【Kurisu】And I thought I told you that that Reading Steiner name is dumb so you should quit it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002454)
【Kurisu】It feels like Engrish. Like a manga special technique.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000246E)
【Kurisu】Its a grammatical mess too. If "steiner" refers to "stein", then it's half German, half English. A mess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000247E)
【Kurisu】By the way, is this Steins Gate or whatever? You've said that too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000248E)
【Rintaro】Heheheh... looks like you've still got your butt birthmark, huh, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000249E)
【Rintaro】Naming is all about feeling. My creativity, comparable to the genius Leonardo Da Vinci, can't be contained by the shackles of grammar! Fuhaha--!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D2)
She hits me again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E2)
Stars fly through my vision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024FC)
【Kurisu】Reflect on your actions a little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000250C)
【Rintaro】I'm sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258A)
Lukako still hasn't stopped crying.
