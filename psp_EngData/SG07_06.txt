#WRITE(PTR, $00000856)
Time leap complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000866)
I stand still in the lab as usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000876)
My brain feels like it's been pinched.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000886)
I endure it while looking at my watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000896)
1:47PM
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A6)
Kurisu's almost done with the Time Leap Machine, and Mayuri's almost done with Lukako's costume. They should both be done in about 10 minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4E)
I leave the lab and sit on the bench at the Braun Tube Workshop's storefront.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5E)
Let's confirm what I should do from here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6E)
Cancel all the D-mails sent so far that changed the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7E)
Of course, that includes D-mails that people besides me sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8E)
The specific D-mails that activated "Reading Steiner"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9E)
I sent several for the experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAE)
For example, part 2 of Operation "Urd"-- the LOTO SIX experiment, counts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABE)
The problem is what other people sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACE)
Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru didn't send any mails that affected Divergence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADE)
Daru sent the strategy to win the Faris Cup to himself in the past, but Reading Steiner didn't activate. That's what I remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEE)
So, I should consider the three that remain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFE)
What Moeka sent. What Lukako sent. What Faris sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0E)
The problem among these three is the last one, the one Faris sent, since I don't know its contents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1E)
So I can't send a cancellation D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2E)
Faris' D-mail brought a dramatic change to Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3E)
All of the moe shops disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4E)
That might be a hint.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5E)
Since I'm the only one who remembers how things were before and after the past changes, I can't get an answer from Faris herself even if I ask her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6E)
But I still have to at least try.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF0)
I should try contacting Faris now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C30)
First, let's try contacting her by phone or by mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C70)
Meeting her directly is best, but MayQueen doesn't exist in this world line, so I'd have to go to that high class apartment complex.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEE)
I decide to call her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9C)
The call tone echoes in my eardrums.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
But there's no sign the line connected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBC)
【Rintaro】gh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001062)
In a hurry, I press the end call button and open up my mailbox.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001072)
I'll write Faris a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001248)
No need to use fancy words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132A)
I send the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001340)
Afterwards, I keep waiting, staring at the mail screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001368)
I've already sent three mails and tried directly calling four or five times, but 30 minutes passed without a single response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001378)
Without hiding my anger, I storm off towards Faris' house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001538)
Faris lives in that tall apartment complex.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001548)
When I arrive, I'm soaked with sweat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001558)
Lately I've done nothing but run. So now I know the limits to my physical strength.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001568)
I need to work on that a little more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001578)
This apartment complex is self-locking, so I have to enter the corresponding room number in the lobby to call.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001588)
I enter the number for Faris' home and a calm man's voice immediately replies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001598)
【Butler】Who is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A8)
Judging by the voice, it's not her dad, but her butler.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
【Rintaro】Umm, I am Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
【Rintaro】I would like to see Fari... I mean Rumiho-san...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
【Butler】I regret to inform you, but the young mistress is not present.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E8)
【Rintaro】Then where is she now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F8)
【Butler】I am afraid I cannot answer that. There is a possibility that you may not be an agreeable person for the young mistress.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001608)
【Rintaro】I've come here before, haven't I!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001618)
【Butler】What you said is true, however, I cannot disclose the location of the young mistress. Please contact the young mistress directly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001628)
He's trying to bluntly break the conversation, so I say something in a hurry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001638)
【Rintaro】P-please wait! I would like to contact Faris right away, but my calls and mails won't connect!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001648)
【Butler】Then please try again some other time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001658)
【Rintaro】...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001668)
For an instant, magma seemed to spout from my stomach, and I almost lost it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001678)
You inflexible geezer!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001688)
I leave the lobby.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A4)
"MayQueen+Nyan⑯" doesn't exist in this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B4)
Faris won't respond to my calls or mails either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C4)
Just where could she be?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D4)
Going underneath the white heat of the sun, I suddenly get an idea.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001846)
--Daru. If anyone knows where she is, it would be that stalker of hers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B26)
【Itaru】Hello, Okarin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B42)
Hm? It seems awfully noisy on the other side of the phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B52)
But I don't care about the details.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B62)
【Rintaro】Daru, do you happen to know where Faris is now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7E)
【Itaru】Faris-tan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9A)
【Rintaro】I want to contact her, even for just a second!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
【Itaru】Right now's impossible, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD2)
【Rintaro】Just tell me where she is! You should have a complete understanding of places Faris would go, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BEE)
【Itaru】I do know where she is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C0A)
【Rintaro】Where!? Where is she!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C26)
【Itaru】UPX's assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C42)
UPX...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C52)
I look above my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C62)
I was standing right in front of UPX.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C72)
【Rintaro】The assembly hall, why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8E)
【Itaru】Today's the finals of the RaiNet AB GranCham.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CAA)
【Rintaro】RaiNet AB GranCham?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC6)
【Itaru】Short for RaiNet Access Battlers Grand Championship, durr.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD6)
【Itaru】It's the final match of the tournament of RaiNetters all over Japan. Faris is participating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE6)
【Itaru】By the way, Faris-tan was this year's winter Grand Championship winner, so she's the defending champion. Just a bit of trivia.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D02)
【Rintaro】Final... match?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1E)
【Itaru】And I'm at the assembly hall, currently spectating. Well, Faris-tan isn't dueling now though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3A)
So that was it...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4A)
【Rintaro】I'm heading over now. What floor!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D66)
【Itaru】Okarin, do you have a ticket?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D82)
【Rintaro】No I don't, but I can manage, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9E)
【Itaru】That's impossible. Security's pretty strict. Seems like there were terrorist threats posted on @channel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DAE)
【Itaru】Pretty sure you can't get in, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DCA)
【Rintaro】Then come out. I'm in front of UPX. I want you to lend me your ticket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE6)
【Itaru】But I refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF6)
【Itaru】It'll end at 4, so you can wait until then, can't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E12)
【Rintaro】H-hey, Daru! Daru!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E62)
【Rintaro】gh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E72)
That inflexible bastard!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E8E)
It's unavoidable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E9E)
Looks like I'll have to wait like Daru said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FBC)
When the clock rolls to 4, tons of people spew out of the building.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FCC)
Mostly parents with children, but there are also men and women in their 20's and 30's.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FDC)
Feels like the customer base is scattered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FEC)
There are cosplayers and people carrying RaiNet paper bags and goods, so they look like the type who would watch the grand championships.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000205E)
Maybe I should try calling Faris again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000207C)
At least the match should be over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022DA)
Why won't she pick up...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000230A)
My irritation reaches its peak.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000231A)
I tell myself to calm down, but he doesn't listen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000232A)
Since I've been hit by so many unreasonable fates, I'm about to explode from frustration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000233A)
While pacing back and forth, I check out the faces of returning spectators.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D0)
I'll try calling Daru again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E0)
But this time, not even Daru answers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002410)
If it's come to this, I just have to swallow my pride.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002420)
【Rintaro】Excuse me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C8)
I approach several men gathered near UPX's entrance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D8)
With tattered leather jackets, and lots of silver accessories, they don't look like the sort of people you usually come in contact with.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E8)
【Rintaro】Do you know where RaiNet Champion Faris-san is?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000252C)
【４℃?】Ahh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000253C)
They suddenly give me dangerous looks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000254C)
【４℃?】RaiNet Champion Faris-san'?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000255C)
【４℃?】Pff, you guys hear that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000256C)
He jerks his chin to his possy surrounding him from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257C)
Snobby, unpleasant laughter resounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258C)
There was also clanking, but this isn't the time to mind that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259C)
【Rintaro】If you know, I'd like you to tell me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025AC)
When I ask, the man starts grinning--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C6)
【４℃2】You a friend of that former champ?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D6)
Former champ...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E6)
Bewildering me, the man draws closer and suddenly bends over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FC)
【Rintaro】!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290C)
Sparks fly under my eyelids as an earthquake runs through my skull.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291C)
I fall onto my back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292C)
It's hot above my brow, as if a branding iron had been pressed onto it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000293C)
But that heat suddenly pulls back, gradually changing into pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000294C)
I finally realize that I had been headbutted from close range.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000295C)
Heyheyhey.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000296C)
Why'd I suddenly get headbutted?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000297C)
Did I do something to this guy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000298C)
Is it some troll reason like he hates my existence or something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A4)
Or is he a Faris <DICT>hater</DICT>?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B4)
I stagger back up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029FC)
It looks like his hat fell off when he headbutted me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A0C)
It was when he stooped down to pick up the hat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B70)
I couldn't overlook that on top of his head-- there was a small space devoid of hair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B80)
A bald spot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C6E)
【４℃3】Sorry for doing that so suddenly... But you asked for it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C7E)
【４℃3】You disturbed my dirty heart, you know... You still called that pussy the champ.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C8E)
【４℃3】Okay? Don't you ever call that inconsiderate Faris woman a champ in front of my face again...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C9E)
【４℃3】If you refuse, then prepare your body and soul to be frozen by me-- the street scene's "Black Absolute Zero", ４℃.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CAE)
What's this guy saying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CBE)
He has such pompous speech and behavioral problems, like he's soaked in his own world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CCE)
【４℃3】I am 4℃. The number 4 and ℃ as in Celsius. 4℃. The strongest and most elegant RaiNetter to descend upon Akiba. Nobody can hold a candle to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE8)
【４℃】Did you know? Dry ice can burn skin--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF8)
【Rintaro】That's not a burn, but frostbite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D12)
【４℃】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D22)
When I point out the scientific truth, the man with a bald spot and his lackeys get pissed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D32)
This doesn't look good. I don't have time to fight here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D98)
So I turn right and--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DA8)
Perform a strategic withdrawal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EBE)
Then I went to the assembly hall, asking each cleanup staff member about Faris. But it was pointless. I couldn't find out where she was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ECE)
When I tried calling Daru again, he said Didn't she already go home? in a half-hearted reply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003024)
I try calling Faris' home on the intercom again, and again, the butler responded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003034)
【Butler】Who is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003044)
【Rintaro】I am Okabe. Has Fari... Has Rumiho returned?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003054)
【Butler】...Please wait one moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003064)
Seems she came home after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003074)
The intercom goes silent for a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003090)
And the self-locking door opens, letting me go inside to the elevator hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030A0)
【Butler】Please come up to the room. It seems the young lady will meet with you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030B0)
I give him my gratitude and hurry into the elevator.
<FILEEND4C>
