【Rintaro】...And without further ado, let us commence the final phase of Operation "Verthandi".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000264)
Mayuri and Daru look at me and nod.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000274)
Today's the last day of ComiMa, which Daru was originally looking forward to attending, but he prioritized this once I begged him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000284)
I take a look around the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000294)
Before I noticed, our lab mem count had returned to three.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A4)
In these past 20 days of turmoil, that number had at one point increased to eight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B4)
All the memories of those days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C4)
All the people we met those days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D4)
I, for the sake of saving Mayuri, will make them never happen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E4)
It is kind of lonely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F4)
I do feel a little guilty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000304)
I will engrave everything deep within my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000314)
I will never forget. I must not forget. About these long yet short summer days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000324)
Even still, I chose to return things to the start by erasing these memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000334)
It has nothing to do with the future Suzuha told us about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000344)
As long as Mayuri will live, it's fine by me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000354)
【Rintaro】Daru, please start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000364)
【Itaru】...this is okay, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000374)
【Rintaro】...yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000038E)
【Itaru】Okey-dokey.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003AA)
Daru begins tapping on the IBN 5100's keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BA)
This retromachine we had finally gotten back was already connected to Daru's favorite cutting-edge PC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CA)
If we use this, we can access SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DA)
We will trespass upon the database at the heart of SERN only accessible with an IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EA)
Then we will locate the data of the First D-mail I sent to Daru on 28th of July, and erase it from Echelon's accumulated log.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FA)
With this, I can access the β World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000040A)
There lies the world where Mayuri doesn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041A)
Spying on Mayuri's condition, I see her sitting down on the couch tightly straightening her spine, with her grandma's memento pocketwatch, "Pocketty~" to her ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000042A)
She's staying quiet with her eyes closed. Whenever Mayuri wants to calm down, she always listens to the sound of that pocketwatch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000043A)
Ever since she parted ways with Kurisu, Mayuri has said nothing about my choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000044A)
It seems like she's prepared herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000045A)
I've been leaving the cracking to Daru, so there's no problem there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046A)
I walk into the development room, having a little left to attend to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000050A)
The Time Leap Machine is placed in the center of the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000051A)
Squatting down, I gently brush the face of the microwave with my fingertip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000052A)
Cool to the touch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000053A)
Ever since I had this, I've met irreplaceable partners, and I've hurt irreplaceable partners.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000054A)
But I don't want to blame the tool.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000055A)
Because everthing depends on how you use the tool.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000056A)
It's also true that I've been saved by this thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000057A)
But still.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000058A)
...When everything's over, I'm going to destroy the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000059A)
So that I never make the same mistakes again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005AA)
【Itaru】Okarin, I found it! It's seriously in there!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067E)
【Rintaro】It's in there? The D-mail I sent!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000698)
【Itaru】It's in there good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A8)
Daru points at a string of characters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B8)
There I could clearly see my name and the text I wrote about Kurisu's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C8)
Three lines total.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D8)
Each only six characters of Japanese.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E8)
SERN found out about us because this data was there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F8)
At FB's instruction, the Rounders, including Moeka, attacked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000708)
If what Suzuha said was true, then if we erased this data, we can escape from the α World Line where SERN dominates the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000718)
Attractor Field β.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000728)
The β World Line that converges to that range.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000738)
There, the future where Mayuri dies in August 2010 doesn't come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000780)
Before I noticed, Mayuri was also standing next to me, gazing at the monitor with great interest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000790)
Her hand firmly grasps mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007AA)
【Mayuri】Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007BA)
【Rintaro】It's okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007CA)
Since she was making an anxious face, I pat her head with a pomf to calm her down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E4)
【Itaru】I set it up so that pressing the enter key will erase the data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F4)
Daru stood up, opening the seat up for me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000804)
【Itaru】I leave that ceremonial act to Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000814)
I sit in the seat when he tells me that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
I gulp down my breath in front of the keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000886)
This time for sure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000896)
This time for sure will bring an end to everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000976)
Kurisu's face floats through my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000986)
I close my eyes and take a deep breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F2)
...goodbye, Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A02)
I slowly raise my right hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A12)
I tightly extend my index finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA2)
【Rintaro】The time of triumph has come!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABC)
Upon my cry, Daru, standing next to me, is taken by surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACC)
【Rintaro】I myself, without giving in to any conspiracy, have adhered to my own belief, fighting the "Ragnarok" to the bitter end!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADC)
【Rintaro】I give gratitude to my comrades, who fought alongside me, as my hands and feet for the sake this triumph!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF6)
If I press this key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B06)
Kurisu will die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B16)
I firmly grasp at the shoulder of my coat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B26)
It's mended with a pink thread, with bumpy stitches.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B36)
【Rintaro】The world we arive at- is the world I wished for!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B46)
Mayuri's life. And also, Kurisu's death. That is what I wished for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B56)
I will never forget this truth. I must never forget.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B66)
This is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B76)
【Rintaro】Everything is Steins;Gate's choice!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B86)
This is the choice I wished for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B96)
【Rintaro】El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA6)
【Rintaro】The world... shall be remade--!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C14)
I vigorously swing down my extended finger--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C24)
--striking the Enter key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D14)
WD13.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C8)
My field of vision spins around me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D8)
The rotation gradually slows, and at the same time, the monochrome world becomes recolored.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E8)
The world becomes still.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F8)
"Reading Steiner" activates.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001108)
The world line... has changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001118)
I look around the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001160)
Daru is standing next to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001234)
Behind me is Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000124E)
When I reach out to her, Mayuri takes my hand with a smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000125E)
I don't see anything especially different throughout the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000126E)
Rather, it looks like nothing has changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127E)
I gently touch the shoulder of my coat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000128E)
There, Kurisu had sewn up the torn seam.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129E)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012AE)
It's gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CA)
My clothes are not torn.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DA)
The bumpy stitches sewn in the dark have disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EA)
There's no trace of the clearly mismatched pink thread either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012FA)
I stand up, and head to the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139A)
The Time Leap Machine placed under the table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AA)
No...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BA)
I noticed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CA)
What was there wasn't the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013DA)
It was the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EA)
Only Kurisu's improved parts had disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FA)
Completely gone--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140A)
The traces of the 20 days Makise Kurisu spent in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141A)
Had completely disappeared from the Earth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142A)
Because the past had changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000143A)
No, maybe I should say "Returned to normal".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000144A)
Kurisu had died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000145A)
20 days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000146A)
So it's obvious there would be no traces.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147A)
I was supposed to be prepared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000148A)
But now, I see the consequences right in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000149A)
I wanted to cry at my bitterness and helplessness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E2)
【Mayuri】Okarin, what's wrong-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F2)
Mayuri chased after me and grabbed my arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001502)
【Rintaro】Say, Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001512)
【Mayuri】Hm? What is it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001522)
【Rintaro】...Who was Lab Member 004 again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001532)
I couldn't help but ask.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001542)
Even though I knew it was pointless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001560)
【Mayuri】004...?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000157A)
 Okarin, Okarin, the only three lab members are Okarin and Mayushii and Daru-kun, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000158E)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
Tears overflowed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170C)
I genuflect on the spot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001766)
I cover my face with my hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001776)
【Rintaro】Yeah... that's right, huh... Our lab... doesn't have... a fourth lab member... there never was...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001786)
The world had negated her existence...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001796)
【Mayuri】Okarin...? Something sad happened to you, didn't it-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180C)
Mayuri's hand rubbed my back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181C)
【Mayuri】You know, Mayushii wants to become strength for Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182C)
I embrace that Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183C)
I subdue my voice, and cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001856)
【Mayuri】Okarin... don't cry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001866)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, please don't leave me... Always stay by my side... please...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001880)
Mayuri nervously strokes my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001890)
