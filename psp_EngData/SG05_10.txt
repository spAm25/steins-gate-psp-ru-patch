About two days later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000202)
Kurisu and Mayuri confined themselves in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000212)
Daru and I also supported Kurisu overnight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000222)
According to Daru's investigation, it should be easy to remotely control mini-black hole generation with the LHC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000232)
For time travel, the mini-black holes evaporate after several seconds inside the LHC at the proton collision point-- where the lifter is installed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000242)
During those few seconds, SERN throws a human into the singular point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000252)
We'll use those few seconds too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000262)
Super gravity at the circumference of the mini-black hole causes infinite compression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000272)
SERN's using the lifter to restrain that overbearing force, but that control is a little loose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000282)
Obviously, the LHC can't influence its global environment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000292)
And the mini-black hole infinite compression phenomenon slightly deallocates memory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A2)
We plan to send binary data at that time to compress it to 36 bytes + α.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B2)
Daru's coding a program to remotely control that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C2)
What I did was search for that certain something that replaces the lifter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D2)
What I understand is that that something isn't inside the microwave, but something interfering with it outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E2)
Kurisu said she never thought about that, but we still haven't figured out what that something outside is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F2)
I consulted Daru about that threat mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000302)
But Daru persistently said they definitely didn't find out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000312)
Of course, I tried to get him to check if we've been tracked, but in the end, he said they didn't find out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000322)
I understand he's confident in his own work, so I trust in Daru too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000332)
If Daru says they didn't find out, then they didn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000342)
But my anxiety wouldn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004F2)
It's Friday, and Kurisu's just about done with the Time Leap Machine development.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000502)
The lifter problem still hasn't been solved, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000512)
With these circumstances, Kurisu once again began speaking her worries.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000055A)
【Kurisu】For the final adjustments, we need to operate the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000056A)
I groan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000057A)
Operate the Microwave Ophone. In other words, activate the discharge phenomenon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000058A)
There's a risk involved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065E)
Needless to say, Mister Braun is downstairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066E)
The discharge phenomenon violently shakes the entire building.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067E)
We've stopped that shaking for these three days so Kurisu could work her improvements, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000792)
Kurisu and Daru look at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A2)
【Itaru】Okarin, I leave the rest to you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B2)
【Kurisu】Backup, please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C6)
【Rintaro】Basically, you want me to ride into enemy territory and die, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D6)
【Kurisu】Your sacrifice will complete the first time leap usage of the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E6)
【Itaru】Besides that, you've always been the one to put Manager in a good mood, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F6)
【Rintaro】In that case, occasionally, you guys should--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000810)
【Kurisu】I can't. That manager's part timer has already labeled me as an enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000820)
【Rintaro】...Fine. But don't forget this. I will absolutely not die! Like the undying phoenix, I will revive, no matter how many times!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C0)
With that said, I ended up being the one to go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000908)
【Mayuri】Okarin, you can't die, okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000918)
Alone in the lounge, making costumes at her own pace, Mayuri sees me off as I head downstairs.
