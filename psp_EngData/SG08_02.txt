#WRITE(PTR, $000001EC)
Walking down the stairs underneath the torii, I walk into the silent grounds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001FC)
I repeatedly hit the intercom on the shrine office next to the main building.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002AA)
【Luka】Yes, who is...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C4)
 ...ah, Okabe-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D8)
Lukako comes out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E8)
Girly as always, even though he's a guy--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F8)
No, wait. This Lukako is a genuine girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000308)
【Rintaro】Lukako, please ask your father for me. An old computer called the IBN 5100 should've been dedicated here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000322)
【Luka】Eh... An old... computer...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000332)
Hm? I clearly saw Lukako go pale when I said old computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000342)
She lowered her face immediately, so I couldn't make sure, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000352)
【Luka】Eh, um, I'll go call my father...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000036E)
Lukako hurries inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000037E)
She looked... like she knew something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000038E)
Luka's dad quickly appears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003D2)
【Luka's Father】Well if it isn't Hououin-kun. Thank you for taking care of my daughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003E2)
I rush the greeting and get down to business.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F2)
【Rintaro】In this shrine, about ten years ago, an old computer was dedicated here. Did you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000040C)
【Luka's Father】An old computer... Hmm, certainly, I do remember that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041C)
【Rintaro】Really!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000042C)
Yayifications! I finally returned to a world line with an IBN 5100!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000043C)
【Rintaro】I'd like you to show me by all means!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000456)
【Luka's Father】Okay. Please wait a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000466)
Luka's dad heads inside the sanctuary in the back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000572)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000616)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006BA)
Lukako's been silently moping for a while now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075E)
She's not calm at all, touching her hair and restlessly looking around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000802)
【Rintaro】Are you afraid of me, Lukako?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BC)
【Luka】Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000960)
【Rintaro】I understand. I mean, after all, I uh... touched, your, uh, your no-no spot, I guess...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0E)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB2)
Crap, I just made things more awkward!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B56)
At least use a more subtle word, dummy!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFA)
【Luka】Afraid of you, Okabe-san? No, not at all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9E)
【Luka】That was really... embarrassing, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D42)
【Rintaro】Sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE6)
【Luka】Okay...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8A)
【Rintaro】By the way, do you know about the IBN 5100?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F38)
【Luka】N-no!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
Lukako shakes her head in an unnatural way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001080)
【Luka】I don't... know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001124)
【Rintaro】But when I called you earlier, you kinda seemed like you knew about it, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011D2)
【Luka】That's...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001276)
Lukako shrinks more and more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131A)
I feel like I'm bullying her again, so I don't press her any further.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BE)
I've done a terrible thing to this girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001462)
So it might be best if we stop our previous master and disciple relationship. I don't plan to keep it either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001506)
I need to treat her more gently, more fitting for a girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AA)
If I don't, I could get sued for sexual harassment. If I'm not careful, I could get convicted for attempted rape or indecency by contact.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164E)
But just how exactly do I treat her more fitting for a girl...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F2)
Cause I've been treating everybody the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001796)
【Rintaro】The costume Mayuri made... in the end, you didn't wear it, did you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001844)
【Luka】Ah, yes...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E8)
【Rintaro】Because it's embarrassing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198C)
【Luka】Yes...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A30)
Why is Lukako this unconfident?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD4)
If that's her nature, then I guess she can't help it, but.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B78)
Didn't she say her reason for becoming a girl was to gain confidence in the first place?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2E)
And yet, she's a girl now, but she still seems the same inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC4)
【Luka's Father】...That's strange.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CDE)
And Luka's dad comes out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CEE)
I'm saved. I was stumped since the conversation wasn't going anywhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CFE)
【Rintaro】Did you find it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D0E)
I try asking just in case, but Luka's dad was empty handed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1E)
He was tilting his head deep in thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D2E)
【Luka's Father】Thing is, I couldn't find it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3E)
【Rintaro】You couldn't find it, meaning?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4E)
【Luka's Father】I certainly remember receiving an old computer, but it wasn't anywhere in the storehouse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5E)
The IBN 5100 isn't in Yanabayashi Shrine--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D7A)
Without thinking, I push my temples and groan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D8A)
So the world's still warped after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9A)
The mirage I can't grip no matter how far I grab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DAA)
The phantom that doesn't respond.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DBA)
The IBN 5100--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DCA)
【Rintaro】...Let me get this straight. The one who dedicated the PC here was Akiha Rumiho-san, if I'm not mistaken?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DDA)
【Luka's Father】Huh, how did you know? Do you know her by chance?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DEA)
【Rintaro】...yeah. We're friends.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E04)
【Luka's Father】Rumiho-chan has grown up to be a splendid young lady, hasn't she?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E14)
【Luka's Father】It was when she was still in elementary school. She came to visit with her butler, Kuroki-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E2E)
【Luka's Father】But why did that computer disappear? I thought someone might have stolen it, but everything else is untouched, and the sanctuary lock isn't broken...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E3E)
What her father just said contradicts Lukako's words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4E)
Lukako said she didn't know about the old PC, the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E5E)
【Luka's Father】Luka, do you know anything about it? For the last annual cleaning day, didn't you sweep the sanctuary?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E78)
【Luka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E88)
Once again, Lukako is hanging her head, almost shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E98)
Her lips, and the hand clenched tight before her chest are faintly trembling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA8)
【Rintaro】Lukako, what's wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB8)
I try asking again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC8)
Lukako doesn't raise her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE2)
【Luka】...I don't know, anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF2)
She says so, while looking like she does know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F02)
Lukako is lying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F12)
Just, why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F22)
It's not rocket science.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F32)
The reason Lukako knows about the IBN 5100 she originally shouldn't know about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F42)
That's--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F52)
Because the world line changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F62)
The cause is probably a D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F72)
In Faris' case, I didn't know what her D-mail was about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F82)
But in Lukako's case, I already clearly know what it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F92)
I want to become a girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA2)
Due to the Butterfly Effect, I should assume that D-mail influenced other circumstances besides Lukako's gender.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB2)
In particular, the whereabouts of the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D4)
It was like that with Suzuha, and with Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E4)
I can't help but think the world's keeping the IBN 5100 away from me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F4)
At any rate, when Lukako sent her D-mail, my demon eye, Reading Steiner, activated. Meaning the D-mail changed the world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002174)
If that means the IBN 5100 won't return to me in this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002184)
Then what I need to do next is "cancel" Lukako's D-mail--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002194)
In other words, I need to turn Lukako back into a guy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A4)
Just then, not because of heatstroke, or "Reading Steiner", I really started to feel vertigo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B4)
Just how do I explain this to the person in question?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021C4)
Just the other day, when I called Lukako a guy, she started crying up a flood. And then Kurisu and Mayuri formed the Lab Mem Girls alliance and severely tortured me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021D4)
Is it possible to turn Lukako back into a guy without causing trouble?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021E4)
This is going to be tough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021F4)
Maybe I should try consulting someone for the time being.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002204)
At first I was going to consult Kurisu, but just this time, it'll be awkward to talk with a girl lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002214)
Let's think a little...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002344)
I visit Manager's house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002354)
The Divergence Meter is here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002364)
I came here to check its value.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B0)
That value was up about 0.05％ from before I canceled Faris' D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C0)
I certainly did move world lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D0)
We're steadily rising to 1％ Divergence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E0)
This meter's value gives me courage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002400)
Just like when I came here before-- though that was in a different world line, so it's the first time for him-- Tennouji recounts memories of Hashida Suzu.
