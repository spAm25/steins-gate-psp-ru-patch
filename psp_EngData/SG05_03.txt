The current search for the IBN 5100 is more difficult than when I found it at Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
...No, instead, maybe I should say that was a miracle?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000021C)
I mean, it's reached urban legend status, and people like Moeka spend several months with zero clues.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000022C)
So when I started searching for it, it was as if I were guided to its discovery in just two or three days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000023C)
That itself was fate... no, Steins;Gate's choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000024C)
That's why I shouldn't regret its loss.。
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000025C)
【Itaru】That's the phantom PC for ya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000026C)
Daru, at his PC like always, whispers calmly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000027C)
【Itaru】I learned this from @chan, but several years ago, a collector apparently paid some dozens of millions of yen before he got one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000028C)
【Itaru】The IBN 5100's dangerous. Seriously dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000029C)
【Rintaro】If it's got that high a premium on it, then...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002AC)
Then people around the world really are aiming for that retro PC's hidden ability!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002BC)
【Itaru】It's really a mystery to people like me. It's actually seriously puzzling as to why it's priced so high.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002CC)
【Itaru】Well, it might be an expensive item in the first place. Since it looks like it cost about $2000 back in the day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002DC)
$2000... That is expensive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002EC)
【Itaru】Anyway, I really don't feel like getting one. It certainly is a nice machine, but that was strictly back in the day. I don't think it's worth getting your eyes bloodshot over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002FC)
【Itaru】Someone's buying them up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000030C)
People feel a psychological need to seek things that are that hard to obtain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003AA)
Now I'm in the same frame of mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BA)
In the depths of SERN, completely isolated from the outside, lies a database constructed of IBN 5100s. Just what information sleeps there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003CA)
Is it SERN's accumulated information that shall become the core to its time machine development?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DA)
Or is it information that proves the existence of the Council of 300 that lies underneath SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EA)
At any rate, I want to expose that area more and more each day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003FA)
My desire to bring chaos is not my only reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000040A)
This is necessary to obtain the trump card to oppose the evil that is SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041A)
There's also that threat mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000042A)
Daru showed confidence that SERN didn't find out about his hacking, but I can't just blindly trust that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000043A)
Anyway, our opponent is the world's best thinkers, the inventors of the world wide web.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000044A)
And they're backed by the secret organization with the influence to silence nations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000045A)
Our opponent is way too strong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046A)
And they'd have no trouble at all to crush our puny lab if they so wished.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047A)
That's the very reason I want a trump card to protect ourselves...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000048A)
But currently, we're stalling, without obtaining an IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000049A)
I'm getting restless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B0)
【Itaru】Woah, what's this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000520)
Daru stops typing and forcefully bends himself to the monitor with peeled eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F4)
【Rintaro】What's wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000604)
【Itaru】No, wait, this is impossible, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000614)
【Rintaro】What are you talking about? Explain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000624)
【Itaru】Well, right now, I examined various ways to get root access to SERN...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000634)
【Itaru】But I never thought the information in SERN's database would fall so quickly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000644)
【Itaru】This is amazing. For some reason, the area around this building has a direct optic line to SERN. And it's not just one line, but several.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000654)
【Rintaro】Direct? Is that different from normal?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000664)
【Itaru】It's literally direct. A fiber optic cable is seriously connecting us directly to SERN in France.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000674)
【Rintaro】Is that different from normal?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000068E)
【Itaru】It's completely different.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000069E)
As if to find an example, Daru calls up a browser window and goes to the National Assembly of France's site.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006AE)
Additionally, he brings up the command prompt and drives in some sort of command.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000712)
【Itaru】Have a look. This is the route this PC took to view the National Assembly of France's site.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000722)
【Itaru】This PC's IP address is in the zeroth position.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000732)
【Itaru】And, after that, it passes through various points in Japan, flies to France, and then goes to the National Assembly's site by way of computers in France.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000742)
【Itaru】So, it takes 16 steps in order to view the National Assembly's site.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075A)
【Itaru】
The average transfer rate is about 300<DICT>ms</DICT>. That's normal for overseas travel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076A)
【Itaru】To put it simply, it's like the "route" to visit French sites from Japan is restricted. Everyone takes the same route.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077A)
【Itaru】And that's not just to France. Other countries are the same. Even for domestic Japan browsing, it takes about 10 steps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000078A)
【Itaru】So next, let's try SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000079A)
Daru calls up SERN's homepage on the browser.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007AA)
Then he calls up the route on the command prompt like last time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007BA)
And then--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007DC)
【Rintaro】There's only one step...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EC)
Unlike the case of the National Assembly, there's not a single intermediate server.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007FC)
The PC we're using-- its registered name is "AKIHABARA_PC"-- literally connects directly to SERN's French server.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
【Itaru】And the transfer rate is hundreds times better than usual. Crazy fast! You can't even get these numbers domestically. And we're even connecting to France.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
The number certainly is on a clearly different scale from the National Assembly's site, even though they're both in France.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
【Rintaro】Why is it direct? Is this even possible?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000864)
【Itaru】It was like this before we cracked. I didn't mess with it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000874)
【Rintaro】So this building has had this hotline to SERN from before...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000884)
【Rintaro】This can't be a coincidence. This might just be Steins;Gate's choi--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000894)
【Itaru】Normally, it would be impossible. Why would Japan's data communication network connect a single independent cable from here all the way to SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A4)
Daru's so excited, he interrupted my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B4)
【Itaru】It's unthinkable that a Japanese or French telecommunication company would set it up. Which means--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C4)
【Rintaro】It was set up by SERN itself, then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D4)
Daru gulps and nods. Cold sweat oozes from his brow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000972)
I feel cold thoughts as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000982)
All of our actions might be going directly to SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000992)
No, maybe--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A2)
Maybe SERN has already been expecting our actions for years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B2)
How could SERN expect that? The answer is simple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C2)
John Titor came from the year 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D2)
SERN completed the time machine in 2034.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E2)
And then in just two years, they construct a dystopia and rule the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F2)
In that case, 2034 SERN could consider our opposition in 2010 a threat and--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A02)
For example, time travel to 2000 with their time machine and furnish our opposition with an optic cable--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A12)
That's entirely possible...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A22)
Can they already wage war across time through the existence of the time machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A32)
I don't think I can win...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A42)
Perhaps we really did make enemies with an unthinkable group.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A52)
No, don't lose heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A62)
That's all just a negative expectation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A72)
I should be able to think more positively.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADC)
【Itaru】But you know, thanks to this direct line, we can now use the LHC from this computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEC)
【Rintaro】We really can!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B62)
【Mayuri】Wah-, that's amazing, Daru-kun-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B72)
Mayuri stops watching her DVD and comes to the computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B82)
【Itaru】Since we have this high a transfer speed. We can remotely control it with almost zero time lag. I haven't actually tried it out, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B92)
That's right. Even if this is SERN's trap, the trap is a double edged sword.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA2)
They should still be weak to our attack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BBC)
【Mayuri】By LHC, you mean that over 20 kilometer long tunnel, right? What exactly does that tunnel do again-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCC)
【Rintaro】It accelerates and collides protons.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE6)
【Mayuri】Ah, yeah. It makes mini-black holes, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF6)
【Itaru】Officially, they announced that there is a possibility of mini-black hole formation as a byproduct of the proton collision process, but that's actually not the case.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C06)
【Rintaro】According to strictly confidential documents, the equipment was made "for the purpose of creating black holes" from the start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C16)
But I noticed I don't know exactly what sort of equipment that is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C26)
I need to review this once--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C36)
【Kurisu】Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD6)
Kurisu unexpectedly appears after having locked herself in the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE6)
She looks awfully serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF6)
【Rintaro】What's wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D46)
【Kurisu】I finally came up with a solution.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D56)
Solution? To what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D66)
【Kurisu】I'm talking about the Microwave Ophone's mechanism.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D76)
【Rintaro】You can explain it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D86)
Kurisu nods while keeping her serious expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D96)
【Kurisu】This is nothing but my hypothesis derived from the extent of my understanding, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA6)
【Kurisu】It's highly related to the LHC you're talking about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB6)
【Rintaro】The LHC is the world's largest Microwave Ophone. I cite that example from you, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC6)
【Kurisu】Correct. Exactly. My expectation was not mistaken.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD6)
【Kurisu】The Microwave Ophone is an unthinkable monster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE6)
Monster...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF6)
【Kurisu】This isn't something that can be kept in this small room. I mean that in a negative way, of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E10)
Kurisu holds her arms like she's trembling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E20)
【Rintaro】Explain the specifics.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E30)
【Kurisu】Do you know how the microwave oven was originally invented by coincidence as a result of radar research?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E40)
Daru and I nod. Mayuri shakes her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E50)
When we first discovered the abnormality of the Microwave Ophone (Temp), we looked into that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E60)
【Kurisu】The generated waves are electromagnetic at a frequency of 2.45GHz. The microwave used in the Microwave Ophone outputs around 1500-2000W.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E70)
【Kurisu】Now, for the important part.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E80)
According to Kurisu, the problem with the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is that its electromagnetic waves, and the electromagnetic waves used in cellphone transmissions--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E90)
Are hardwired at a fairly high level-- enough that you could say they "fuse".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA0)
【Rintaro】Certainly, according to Daru's blueprint, the microwave and the phone are made to send out shared electromagnetic waves by taking a lead and--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB8)
【Rintaro】Hardwiring each of them to the <DICT>magnetron</DICT>'s cathode and anode.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC8)
The microwave oven's super strong electromagnetic waves, originally discovered by chance from military-grade radar research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED8)
And the cellphone's electromagnetic waves, now standard around the world and allowing phone calls to be made globally.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE8)
What happens when you fuse both of the waves?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF8)
【Kurisu】Both of them use electromagnetic waves in unison.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
【Kurisu】 It's not like I can investigate how far, or how strong of an influence that has, though, since I'm not a specialist. I can't begin to imagine--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F18)
【Kurisu】If we think of the cellphone as a stepping stone, scattering the surrounding electromagnetic waves which can affect a vast range of hundreds of kilometers--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F28)
【Kurisu】Then not just Akihabara, but all of Tokyo will become the same as the inside of a microwave oven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F38)
【Kurisu】With negligible body weight dependence, the average time until death for the people inside is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F48)
【Kurisu】Three minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F58)
【Mayuri】Eh-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F68)
【Itaru】Seriously? Then isn't the Microwave Ophone a weapon of mass destruction!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F78)
I-is it really that unthinkable...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F88)
【Kurisu】I'll teach you about what happens inside that Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
【Kurisu】Inside the oven, invisible to the naked eye, electromagnetic waves increase the energy levels of hydrogen atoms. This is the normal function of a microwave oven.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA8)
【Kurisu】And there, the cellphone's scattering electromagnetic waves are added--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB8)
【Kurisu】Causing every particle inside the oven to keep colliding, increasing in mass as they begin to approach the speed of light in circular motion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC8)
【Kurisu】That's something like an "accelerator" so to speak.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD8)
【Rintaro】Accelerator...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE8)
Literally the same as the LHC...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF8)
【Rintaro】So, if the LHC was created to generate mini-black holes--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001008)
【Rintaro】Then does the Microwave Ophone (Temp) also produce mini-black holes as well!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001018)
Kurisu--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001028)
Doesn't deny it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001038)
【Kurisu】It's a miracle this thing operated so stably.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E4)
【Kurisu】But there's still one thing I don't understand--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001188)
【Kurisu】Even if mini-black holes are created, they should evaporate instantaneously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000122C)
【Kurisu】But it doesn't seem like that with the Microwave Ophone. That's clear from how it turns bananas and karaage into Jellymen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D0)
【Kurisu】Just like with the LHC, the mini-black holes change into Kerr black holes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001374)
【Rintaro】According to Titor's theory, it's necessary to inject electrons to produce the mini-black hole to Kerr black hole effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001418)
【Kurisu】Where do the injected electrons come from? I don't get that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014BC)
【Kurisu】The LHC uses a lifter to inject electrons into the black holes, controlling the gravitational field.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001560)
【Kurisu】Something's substituting the lifter somewhere in the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001604)
【Itaru】S-somewhere?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B2)
【Kurisu】Like I said, I don't know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001756)
So in the end, is that where the problem leads?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FA)
Kurisu's explanation does nothing but prove that our vague hypothesis that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is same as the LHC isn't incorrect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189E)
【Rintaro】It looks like we need to review what the LHC is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001954)
This is our LHC moe guy, Daru's time to shine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019B8)
【Itaru】LHC stand for Large Hadron Collider. In Japanese, I guess it's "Shoutotsugatakasokuki"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C8)
【Mayuri】Had drawn?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D8)
【Kurisu】It's the name of a particle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019E8)
【Itaru】And so, its physical form is a large circular underground tunnel constructed underneath France and Switzerland.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F8)
【Itaru】Its total length is 27 kilometers. Its depth is about 100 meters underground.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A08)
【Itaru】Two rings pass inside the tunnel. Inside the rings is a super low temperature vacuum. So basically, a reproduction of outer space environments. Seriously moe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A18)
【Itaru】Proton acceleration occurs in an adjacent facility, where they're gradually accelerated by the linear accelerator, proton synchrotron booster, and SPS.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A28)
【Itaru】Finally, they're injected into the LHC, where they undergo their final acceleration via superconducting magnets spread throughout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A38)
【Itaru】At the end, they reach up to 99.9999991％ of the speed of light. The LHC's dangerous. Not the same level as the Microwave Ophone, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A48)
【Itaru】But the accelerated protons collide around 1~10 billion times per second.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A58)
【Itaru】And the purpose of the LHC project is to observe the high energies caused from the resulting reactions... or so they say. That was a huge lie, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A68)
That's about how much we reviewed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B36)
【Rintaro】And that's where I'd like to hear from all of you lab mem ladies and gentlemen. Can our Microwave Ophone (Temp) forestall SERN's physical time travel or not?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B46)
【Kurisu】Two problems. The designation of the local field, and the lifter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B56)
【Rintaro】For the local field designation, it's just as you said. The D-mail precisely arrives at its specified destination.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B66)
【Kurisu】...It's dangerous to come to a conclusion without verification.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B76)
I have no objection at all to that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B86)
【Rintaro】As for the object that replaces the burden of the lifter, we already know it "exists" so we just need to find "what" it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
【Kurisu】I don't think we can find it. I've already searched the small interior of the Microwave Ophone for days without finding a hint.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
【Kurisu】Even if we do find it, it takes an enormous amount of time to adjust the volume of electron injection.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
【Itaru】How enormous?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC6)
【Kurisu】SERN spent 9 years and still can't solve it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD6)
So basically, it will take amateurs like us even longer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE6)
Just then, a certain idea flashed into mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF6)
【Rintaro】Then let's try to think things conversely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C06)
【Rintaro】SERN tried out physical human time travel, but adjusting the volume of electron injection didn't go smoothly. The singular points were not made naked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C16)
【Rintaro】It's the same thing with the Microwave Ophone (Temp). The amount of data that can be safely sent without turning into a Jellyman is just 36 bytes + α.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C26)
【Rintaro】That's where we think conversely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C36)
【Rintaro】If we convert a human's entirety to data, how do you think we can compress that data into just 36 bytes + α?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C46)
【Rintaro】Then we can send that person through the ring singularity just like a D-mail, can't we!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C64)
【Itaru】Convert a human's entirety to data? That's not even possible, man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C74)
【Itaru】And even if you could, that data's capacity would be astronomical, right? Then how could you compress that into 36 bytes? You an idiot? You wanna die?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C84)
【Rintaro】Mm, mmm, I thought it was a good idea, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C94)
So, the barrier to time travel is thick after all, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA4)
And then, I notice Kurisu's expression had changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB4)
For some reason, her eyes are wide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC4)
Her mouth is half open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD4)
【Kurisu】I see... In that case, maybe--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE4)
And then the next words Kurisu says:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF4)
【Kurisu】Maybe we can do it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1E)
It...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D2E)
We can do what? Time travel?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3E)
Even though it was my idea, I really can't believe Kurisu's words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4E)
【Rintaro】Are you serious?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5E)
I ask again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D78)
In response, Kurisu grins a smile of triumph.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D88)
【Kurisu】Super compression of data, at least, is simple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D98)
【Kurisu】We can just use the black holes created by the LHC. Since black holes super compress everything they swallow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA8)
【Kurisu】If all we compress is data, then it's not like crushing a human to death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB8)
Ohh, I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC8)
Wait, I understand it now that you explain it, but can we really pull off such a stunt?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD8)
And most importantly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE8)
【Rintaro】How do you plan to convert humans into data?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF8)
【Kurisu】You do know that my thesis got published in Science magazine, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E08)
【Rintaro】Why are you bragging all of a sudden?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E18)
【Kurisu】Did you read that thesis?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E28)
I haven't looked at it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E38)
【Itaru】Ah, if you want that issue of Science magazine, I've got it scanned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E50)
Daru opens up his image folder, scrolls through tons of porn, none of which is <DICT>3DPD</DICT>, and opens up the obvious Science scan data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EAC)
And sure enough, there's Makise Kurisu's name, signed in English--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EBC)
【Kurisu】The title of the thesis is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ECC)
【Kurisu】"Analysis of Nerve Impulses in Relation to Memories Accumulated in the Temporal Lobe"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EDC)
【Rintaro】...Temporal lobe? Nerve impulse?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EEC)
【Itaru】Huh, Okarin, you don't know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F04)
【Rintaro】No, wait. Don't mock me. This title, umm, it's more in the scope of <DICT>neuroscience</DICT> than physics...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6E)
【Kurisu】Neuroscience is my specialty, so?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F7E)
I'm stunned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F8E)
She can talk physics in that amount of detail, and she's so well versed in time travel hypotheses that I was under the impression she specialized in physics...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F9E)
【Rintaro】No, enough about that. How is this related to time travel?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB8)
【Kurisu】Converting the entirety of a human into data is impossible--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC8)
【Kurisu】But converting the entirety of a human's "memories" may be possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD8)
Converting memories... into data?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FE8)
The specifics of Kurisu's thesis go as follows:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002050)
In the temporal lobe exists the parahippocampal gyrus, where all of a human's memories accumulate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002060)
But what exactly are memories? Kurisu's thesis says that it's been analyzed from a neuroscientific perspective.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002070)
All of the brain's functions manifest as electrical signals running through its neurons as nerve impulses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002080)
That's why it can be said that even people's memories are engraved into the hippocampus by electrical signals.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002090)
Kurisu analyzed how electrical signals corresponded to their counterpart memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A0)
The mechanism with which we recall memories is like a word association game. Even if the image to be recalled is broad, that becomes the key to finely detailing it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B0)
【Kurisu】You start pulling the drawers of a dresser one by one, and small boxes are packed inside each one. Inside each box is a plethora of smaller boxes. You can think of it like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C0)
Retrieval signals, which are necessary for memory recollection, seem to exist in an unexpectedly large number of varieties. Among hundreds of millions of nerve impulse patterns--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D0)
--thousands of signals are related to memory. The analysis of all of those patterns was the result of Kurisu and her research team.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E0)
【Kurisu】This single study may seem unrelated to Okabe's idea, but there's one more thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F0)
【Kurisu】In the university I attended-- Victor Condoria University, the Neurophysiology Laboratory developed the technology called Visual Rebuilding, or VR for short, several years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002112)
【Kurisu】For a simple explanation, it's a technology that allows conversion of video data into nerve impulse signals.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002122)
【Kurisu】It can go the other way and convert nerve impulses into normal electrical signals, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002132)
【Kurisu】And so, by combining this VR technology, and our research... do you see where I'm going?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002142)
【Itaru】...no way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002152)
【Rintaro】Conversion of human memories into data?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002162)
【Kurisu】Not just that. Memory transplantation, backups, and external storage... all of those things become possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002172)
How sci-fi...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002182)
This is almost like storing a soul.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002192)
According to Kurisu, some religious groups strongly opposed this, just as expected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A2)
But on the other hand, it seems like something the medical community would praise as groundbreaking research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B2)
In any case, conversion of people's memories into data seems very manga-tic-- but this assistant was able to accomplish such unthinkable research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021C2)
Of course, she didn't accomplish it by herself. She did have the cooperation of her enrolled university's laboratory, but still.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002286)
【Rintaro】So basically, is this what you want to say? Using the same fundamentals of D-mails, we can retrieve the memories of the test subject stored inside the brain as light signal data--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002296)
【Rintaro】Use the mini-black holes created by the LHC to super compress that data into 36 bytes + α size--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022A6)
【Rintaro】Send that data through the Kerr black hole ring singularities formed by the Microwave Ophone (Temp)--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B6)
【Rintaro】And then drive just the subject's memories into his own brain in the past through cellphone usage--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C6)
【Mayuri】What does that mean-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D6)
【Kurisu】Only their memories will leap through time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E6)
【Kurisu】In order to differentiate it from physical time travel, let's define it as a time leap for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F6)
【Kurisu】It's not physical transfer of the flesh, just sending memories into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002306)
【Kurisu】It's so erratic a method that nobody has honestly thought of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002316)
I guess that's a blind spot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002326)
It's too unrealistic, but because of that, none of the great thinkers of SERN would've looked towards it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002336)
It's a feat combining physics, neuroscience, and neuroelectrophysiology.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002346)
To time leap, to transfer memories via cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002360)
【Kurisu】The point is that only memories are being transferred.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002370)
【Kurisu】Personality and consciousness aren't included.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002380)
【Rintaro】What does that mean? Is something different about it compared to time leaping in scifi novels?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000239A)
【Kurisu】The time leaping in scifi and stuff sends everything including consciousness, personality, and memory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023AA)
【Kurisu】But it would probably be too much data to send the consciousness and personality as well, and my laboratory only analyzed memories in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023BA)
【Kurisu】Think of consciousness, personality, and memory as separate things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023CA)
【Kurisu】Memories are the same as video or image data on a computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023DA)
【Kurisu】And the consciousness and personality are like the OS.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F4)
【Itaru】But in terms of data size, videos and images can be larger than the OS.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002404)
【Kurisu】It's just an example.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002414)
【Kurisu】In the first place, it's still not clear where personality and consciousness are located, how they're constructed, or how they're formed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002424)
【Kurisu】That's why we can't convert them into data, or at least, I can't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002434)
【Rintaro】What sort of demerit can we expect with just memories?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244E)
【Kurisu】It's not like personality is formed just by memories. That's why, even if you send memories, everything still depends on the recipient's consciousness and personality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002466)
【Itaru】In terms of "<DICT>Mindorz</DICT>", it's like copy-pasting data from a VISTA computer to a 95 computer, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002476)
【Kurisu】The data created with the latest OS might not work on an older OS. It may be incompatible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002486)
【Kurisu】So, for example, if you sent your current memories to yourself in elementary school, the gap between your memories and your body may cause a mental disability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002496)
【Rintaro】Anyway, is it correct to assume it's a prerequisite to only send memories to your own body in the past?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A6)
Kurisu nods at my question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B6)
【Kurisu】Just like with D-mails, we're leaping with a cellphone as an intermediate, so--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C6)
【Kurisu】To be exact, I think you can only leap to your own body in the past, and only at the times you had a cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D6)
There was an exception with Lukako's case where we sent a D-mail to a pager, but that doesn't apply to time leaping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E6)
【Kurisu】And the destination has to be the same person or... umm, for example, there's the concern that the electrical signal could be rejected without matching.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002508)
【Itaru】It would be really bad if it entered someone else's body, huh. But I'd happily enter a <DICT>little missy</DICT> though. Uhehe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002518)
Is this guy incapable of non-perverted thought?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002532)
【Kurisu】Don't "Uhehe" me, you idiot!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002542)
【Kurisu】It would be good if it just repelled, but I'm concerned it might even cause a serious personality disorder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002552)
【Kurisu】I don't know the result. Since this is a first for mankind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002562)
That first for mankind phrase has a nice ring to it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257C)
【Kurisu】What I do know is that you should definitely not go to before you were born, and that there's no reason for two of you to exist simultaneously. So-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258C)
【Kurisu】You won't have to worry about time paradoxes. You can't kill your parents before you're born.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259C)
【Rintaro】So the cellphone replaces the black hole and white hole, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025AC)
It was a coincidence, as well as an inevitability that the intermediate item would be the cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025BC)
Since the cellphone is a personal terminal, it's highly unlikely that anyone other than the owner would pick it up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025CC)
Goosebumps rise all over my body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025DC)
【Rintaro】Hehehe, hehehehehe, fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002606)
I immediately whip out my phone and place it to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000261E)
【Rintaro】It's me. All these points of data make a beautiful line. ...Yeah, the plan is now entering its final stage. ...Naturally, I mean Operation <DICT>"Verthandi"</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000262E)
【Rintaro】Hmph, Christina's been successfully tricked, but... she has been accepted into the lab mems, which to us, is surely what Steins;Gate's choice had dictated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000263E)
【Rintaro】Fret not. I'll prove that I can pull it off. Now we are invincible. El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002690)
I put away my phone and turn to Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A0)
【Rintaro】It's just as I said. Oh, Christina, now, we commence Operation "Verthandi"!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026BA)
【Kurisu】No, explain yourself a little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026CA)
【Rintaro】We'll adopt the entirety of your time leap plan. By the way, I won't allow you to say you can't do the data conversion of intracranial information after all this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026DA)
【Kurisu】Well, since we're in Akihabara, I can get all the parts I need, so I guess I can manage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026EA)
【Rintaro】It's decided. I appoint you as commander of this operation. You may use Daru and me as you wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026FA)
【Rintaro】Let's complete the first Time Leap Machine in the history of mankind...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002714)
Kurisu doesn't decline.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002724)
Rather, her eyes were filled with the fire of the fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002734)
She really is a natural-born scientist. I'm convinced of that.
