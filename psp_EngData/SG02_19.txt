At 8 o'clock, the two of us silently ate cup noodles and warmed bananas and ever since then, we've been examining the Microwave Ophone (Temp).

I mainly examined the terminal mode settings through the X68000.

Kurisu's been examining the AC adapter and the lab's switchboard for a while. Though we stopped her when she tried to disassemble them.

Where is she staying in the first place?

She came to Japan one or two months ago, and she did say she was going home this month.

Though, the trains might not be running at this time. She might not be able to go back.

I want to tell her to go home before the last train, but... Don't tell me she plans to stay...!?

No girls have ever stayed over at the lab. Mayuri has a curfew, so she always goes back home to Ikebukuro.

Daru and I frequently stay here, though. It's not an exaggeration to say that Daru and me live here half the time.

Kurisu turns to me and sighs.

【Rintaro】Wha...!

#WRITE(PTR, $00000890)
Living at a hotel?

Well, certainly, renting out an apartment for a month long stay is absurd, but--

【Rintaro】You damn celebrity...! If you're American, then you should use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?

【Kurisu】I'm not American, and there aren't any motels in the heart of Tokyo, are there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2A)
【Rintaro】What sort of hotel?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD8)
【Kurisu】What sort? It's a normal hotel in Ochanomizu.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7C)
【Rintaro】Ochanomizu? Then you can walk from here to there, can't you?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D20)
【Kurisu】I guess.

【Kurisu】Why are you interested in my father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE6)
【Rintaro】You're the one who blabbed about your father, aren't you? Isn't that basically a hidden message saying "please give me some advice about my father, please"?

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101E)
Kurisu doesn't look me in the eye.

Maybe I should apologize.

【Rintaro】What about the database uisng IBN 5100s?

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C6)
【Itaru】Since that exists independently, it's completely unrelated, durr.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E0)
【Itaru】To begin with, it's a database using a special program, so there's a limit on who can access it. Doesn't look like even chief executive class can access it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F0)
【Rintaro】There are positions beyond chief executive class?

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140A)

#WRITE(PTR, $00001434)

#WRITE(PTR, $0000149C)
Kurisu looks at me coldly.

Whatever. Let's leave the IBN 5100 database for another day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C8)
【Rintaro】Daru, go search for any information on time travel theory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E2)
【Itaru】Okey dokey. That "Z Program" we saw last time was suspicious, wasn't it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F2)
【Rintaro】That, and the "Jellyman's Report".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001502)
We couldn't get a concrete summary of either of them in the end.

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D6)
Kurisu stares holes into the monitor.

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E6)
The earlier atmosphere of anger on her face had disappeared.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164E)

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165E)
【Rintaro】I have no doubt that Z stands for jelly!

"Z Program" and "TOP SECRET" are written on it.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001826)

#WRITE(PTR, $00001846)
I asked Daru, but Kurisu answers indifferently instead.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001856)
I thought that SERN might've been made for the Z Program, but '54 means my guess was off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001866)
【Rintaro】When was the IBN 5100 put on market?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001876)
【Itaru】1975.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001886)
So maybe SERN used the IBN 5100 as its backbone.

【Itaru】H-hey, Okarin. Remember when we hacked earlier? I'm pretty sure, that this was written in that mail we read...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242A)
【Itaru】Results: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. The details were enclosed in the Jellyman's Report or something...

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243A)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244A)
Human is dead. A person had died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002464)
【Itaru】Was that human experimentation... or something related?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002474)
My throat goes dry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002484)
Cold sweat seeps through my brow, and it's not because of the heat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002494)
Kurisu and Daru await my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A4)
Does that mean they're entrusting the decision to me?

Though that may be true, pretending not to see this conspiracy would leave a bad taste.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C6)
【Rintaro】Daru... look up the Jellyman's Report.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E0)
【Itaru】Seriously?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F0)
【Rintaro】Seriously. However, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000260A)
【Kurisu】Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000261A)
【Rintaro】You, go home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002634)
【Kurisu】Why now all of--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002644)
【Rintaro】The Jellyman's Report... gives me a bad feeling. Once we see it, we can no longer return to our normal lives.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002654)
【Rintaro】You're such a genius that at your age, you got a thesis published in "Science". There's no need to throw away your promising future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002664)
【Kurisu】Are you worried about me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002674)
【Rintaro】Of course. You are my assistant after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000268E)
【Kurisu】...I keep telling you, I'm not your assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000269E)
【Kurisu】Thanks for your concern. But I won't go home. We need to expose this truth to the world--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026AE)
【Rintaro】No! That's too dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026BE)
【Kurisu】You afraid?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026CE)
【Rintaro】We're too powerless against this conspiracy. If we make the wrong move, they'll erase us immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E8)
【Kurisu】But still--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F8)
【Rintaro】This isn't a game. I'm not joking here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002712)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002722)
【Kurisu】...I understand. Let's not expose it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002732)
Though her expression shows she still doesn't agree, she finally submits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002742)
【Kurisu】But I'm not going home. It'll keep me awake at night.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002752)
【Rintaro】You won't regret it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002762)
【Kurisu】I won't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002772)
She declares firmly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002782)
I don't know if it's her competitive spirit, or if it's her bravery, or if she's just ignorant to the ways of the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002792)
But it doesn't look like I can persuade her any further.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027A2)
【Rintaro】What about you, Daru? Prepared?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027BC)
【Itaru】Well, I am a super hacker.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CC)
He's comfortable even in this situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027DC)
【Itaru】I wouldn't make such a mistake that we'd get found out in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027EC)
That settles it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027FC)
It's great that Mayuri's not here. I can't get her involved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000280C)
I look Daru and Kurisu in the eye.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000281C)
【Rintaro】Alright... let's begin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002838)
Kurisu gives the seat to Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002850)
【Rintaro】Now, the current operation name shall be <DICT>Laegjarn</DICT>'s Box
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002898)
【Kurisu】Why Norse mythology?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E0)
【Itaru】Hehh, Norse mythology? Probably because it's cool?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F0)
【Kurisu】To begin with, men who say things like operation name...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002900)
【Rintaro】Daru, begin operations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000293A)
He soon finds the Jellyman's Report.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000294A)
It required a second password authentication, but Daru broke through it easily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002992)
【Itaru】Okay? I'm opening it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029AC)
Daru looks at Kurisu and me as he asks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029BC)
I gently lick my lips and nod.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029CC)
A gloomy atmosphere drifts about the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029DC)
Since the window's closed, the strange heat accumulates.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A04)
Daru wipes the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief, and timidly presses the enter key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A14)
It--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A24)
At first glance, looks like a resume.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A34)
There's a photograph on the top right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A44)
The top left has name, age, height, weight, origin, and other information.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A54)
Written in the center is a long string of English text--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A64)
Underneath that, is something like a scan of a newspaper clipping with a black and white picture attached.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A74)
And then I knew.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A84)
What exactly the Jellyman in Jellyman's Report meant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AF2)
【Kurisu】"Jellyman's Report 10"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B02)
【Kurisu】"Subject: James McCarthy, Age: 31, Origin: America"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B12)
【Kurisu】"Z Program 4, Experiment Date: 2005-01-28 T 13:05"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B22)
Kurisu bend over Daru's shoulder, reading what's written out loud.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B32)
【Kurisu】"Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch."...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B42)
【Itaru】That again...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B52)
【Kurisu】"It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the singular point inside the Kerr black hole."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B62)
【Kurisu】"April 3, 1921, The right half of a dead man was discovered buried into the surface of a wall in New York's 14th District."...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B72)
It looks like Kurisu's reading the newspaper article at the end with the black and white photo attached.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B82)
【Kurisu】"The unidentified man's corpse--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B92)
【Kurisu】was completely gelified."...
