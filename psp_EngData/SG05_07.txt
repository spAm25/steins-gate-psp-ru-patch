#WRITE(PTR, $00000806)
We finish our shopping and come out in front of the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084E)
【Rintaro】Oh yeah, Mayuri. Have you not been working at a part time job lately?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085E)
【Mayuri】Job? You mean at "Lemoine"-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086E)
That's right. In the current Akiba devoid of moe shops, "MayQueen+Nyan⑯" doesn't exist any more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087E)
【Mayuri】Well, it's right before ComiMa, so I'm taking days off-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088E)
【Mayuri】I gotta do give cosplay making my all-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089E)
【Rintaro】Exactly how many costumes are you making this year?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B8)
【Mayuri】Three. Umm, for Kaede-chan and Fubuki-chan. And then one for Luka-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1C)
Lukako probably still doesn't want to wear it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2C)
Well, of course not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3C)
After all, even though he looks like that, he's still a genuine guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4C)
No, wait. That was before we sent the D-mail. Now she's a genuine girl, I guess. How complicated...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A66)
【Mayuri】Ah..., it's Moeka-san.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEC)
【Rintaro】What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3C)
I look where Mayuri's pointing to, and see her squatting at the staircase to the station's smoking area, staring at her cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BDA)
And she looks awfully serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEA)
There are shadows all around her eyes, and her hair is frayed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BFA)
She seems more worn out than the last time I've seen her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
I hesitate to call out to her, feeling an unusual atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1A)
She's ignored me before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2A)
It's quite difficult to deal with that Shining Finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8E)
But as a fellow lab mem, I can't just ignore her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
【Rintaro】You, Shining Finger! You seem pretty depressed, don't you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
【Mayuri】Tutturu-, Moeka-san. What are you doing here-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2C)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3C)
Moeka doesn't look up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4C)
She mutters something, but I can't quite catch it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5C)
【Rintaro】Hey, are you listening? If you have any worries at all, this insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, will splendidly settle them for you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6C)
【Rintaro】That is, if you're prepared to see Akiba become a sea of blood... hehehe
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8C)
Moeka overreacts to my words with a twitch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE8)
She lifts her head and stares at me with open eyes. Or so I thought. She gets up with a staggering force, drawing closer to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF8)
This is the first time I've seen Moeka express so much emotion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E08)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E18)
【Rintaro】What is it? What's wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E28)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E38)
So she can't speak directly after all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E52)
Moeka hangs her head and starts typing on her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E62)
Looks like she's writing another mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F76)
【Rintaro】What do you mean, what happened?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F90)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A4)
【Rintaro】It's not fully understood yet. We're in the middle of improving it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
【Mayuri】It's amazing-. You know, they say this time, we might be able to time leap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
【Rintaro】Don't report it. If you do, we'll have to excommunicate you as a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001226)
Moeka violently shakes her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001236)
Seems she won't report it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001246)
【Rintaro】Through hacking SERN, we discovered another possibility for the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001256)
【Rintaro】It's a new time travel system made possible by borrowing part of SERN's equipment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001266)
【Rintaro】This will repaint the history of mankind, advancing it one more step up the ladder. That is, the conquest of the barrier of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001276)
【Rintaro】Thus, people won't be washed away by the future, but be able to choose their own.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001286)
【Rintaro】Our Future Gadget Laboratory will soon accomplish that which is unprecedented throughout all of the history of mankind...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CE)
【Mayuri】Okarin Okarin, that explanation was so roundabout, that you lost Mayushii.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DE)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EE)
To be unable to understand my message is to have not a shred of emotion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001314)
Moeka bites her lip and irritatedly types out a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001324)
She grabs my upper arm and sinks in her fingernails, rather painfully.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001334)
【Rintaro】W-will you let go of me, please...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001344)
But Moeka wouldn't listen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001458)
【Rintaro】Time leaping, in other words, sending your memories across time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001468)
【Rintaro】We found a way to make that possible. Before long, we'll actually time leap, and become conquerors of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B0)
【Mayuri】Well, Okarin came up with the idea, Chris-chan said it was possible-, Daru-kun's helping, and Mayushii and Okarin are out shopping-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C0)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014DC)
Moeka absentmindedly lets go of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EC)
She squats down on the spot, just as we had found her-- no, wait, she looks even more powerless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001506)
【Mayuri】Moeka-san? Are you okay? Do you feel bad-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001516)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001620)
【Rintaro】I won't say any more than that. There are still several problems left to solve. If we can settle those easily, I guess it'll be complete in a week.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001630)
【Rintaro】But if we can't settle them, then it won't ever be complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001640)
【Rintaro】Everything is Steins;Gate's choice. I believe that we will surely find the path to settle them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001650)
【Rintaro】And once the door is opened, what will visit is the chaos I desired. Curtains shall fall on the "Organization" that rules the world from the shadows at the hands of the Ragnarok...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001660)
【Mayuri】Okarin, who are you fighting-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001670)
【Rintaro】They never appear on center stage, but they manipulate the governments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001680)
【Mayuri】Heeh, amazing~. But you shouldn't do anything dangerous, okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001690)
Why is Mayuri the one looking out for me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A0)
【Moeka】hm...hm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
Oh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CA)
While sitting, Moeka's lips curl up into a smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001712)
【Moeka】Hmhmhm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172E)
Unlike last time, she gets up sluggishly and staggers off as if she had forgotten about our existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173E)
Mayuri and I could do nothing but see her off once we felt her ghastly atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174E)
【Mayuri】What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175E)
I thought she was a weird girl since I first met her, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176E)
Maybe she's a mental patient.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177E)
Hehehe, but I'm the most ill of us all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178E)
After all, what I wish for is world chaos.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179E)
【Rintaro】Fuhaha, Fuhahahaha, Foooohahaahahaahahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EE)
【Mayuri】Whaaah? Even Okarin's getting weird-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FE)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's worried...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001814)
I stop my loud laughter once I see her about to cry.
