Moeka keeps taking pictures for thirty minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
The period between shutter sounds start to lengthen, but she keeps adjusting her angle with a serious expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000021C)
--You're not photographing a model.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000022C)
I gaze at that spectacle from the lounge, half amazed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000023C)
I stuff my cheeks with banana for breakfast.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000024C)
I didn't want to go to the convenience store because Moeka's here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000025C)
I know she can't carry it off by herself, but there's still the danger that Moeka could take the IBN 5100 away if I take my eyes off her.

#WRITE(PTR, $000002FE)
And then, I got a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000031C)
Dammit, what is it this time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033A)
It's so absurd that I have to go along with her tedious mail interaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000046A)
【Rintaro】Didn't I tell you you can't?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047A)
I direct my answer towards the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000048A)
【Rintaro】Besides, that thing weighs a ton. You can't carry it by yourself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000594)
【Rintaro】No, no. Wait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000668)
【Rintaro】Why are you assuming I'll lend it to you!? I thought I said I wouldn't!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000682)
【Moeka】...Really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000692)
【Rintaro】Really.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006AC)
【Moeka】...No matter what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006BC)
【Rintaro】No matter what.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D6)
Once again, Shining Finger does her thing, typing on her phone at high speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000778)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D0)
Why is she going out of her way to send me a one word mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E0)
Troublesome woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008FA)
It's probably just another worthless mail from Shining Finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090A)
If she wants to assert herself, then she should speak up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000952)
She silently glances at me more, and for some reason, begins to lift the cardboard box.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000962)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000972)
【Rintaro】Wh-, hey, hey, hold it right there!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A46)
【Rintaro】
What are you doing!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A60)
【Moeka】...Bringing it home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A70)
【Rintaro】Don't screw with me! Who said you could!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A80)
Well, it's not like she can lift this ridiculously heavy behemoth with those slender arms of hers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A90)
【Moeka】You didn't, reply, to my mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA0)
【Rintaro】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD2)
I hurry up and check the mail that just came.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5A)
Hoh, if I don't reply that means it's okay to bring it home, I see the logic behind--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D70)
【Rintaro】Er, that argument's irrational!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D80)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D90)
【Rintaro】Anyway, leave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA0)
Moeka keeps clinging to the cardboard box.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF0)
She takes my words and reluctantly stands up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E04)
【Rintaro】Okay? Just listen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1E)
【Rintaro】The phantom retro PC, the IBN 5100, has chosen me, Hououin Kyouma, to be its contractual master.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2E)
【Rintaro】That's the undeniable truth. Not even God can change this decision. It is Steins;Gate's choice!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3E)
【Rintaro】In the first place, I'm only borrowing this thing the IBN 5100's power temporarily. When I'm done with it, I'm returning it to its original owner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E58)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDA)
Like I said, stop with the mails!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
【Rintaro】I can't tell you that. I'm sworn to confidentiality through the contract, and I must protect the original owner from those who desire the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0A)
Actually, maybe. Maybe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1A)
Maybe if Moeka seduced Luka's dad and asked to borrow the IBN 5100, he might just lend it to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2A)
And then I couldn't complain when Moeka takes away the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3A)
I must avoid that situation at all costs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F54)
Well, I don't think Moeka can seduce anyone with the way her character is. And since Luka's dad has a wife and kids, I don't think he'd fall easily either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104E)
I'm probably just thinking to much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105E)
Moeka hangs her head without saying a single complaint.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106E)
【Rintaro】...I'm not that evil.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001088)
【Rintaro】I formed a contract with the IBN 5100this thing for my own goals. After I achieve those goals, you can negotiate with the original owner to form a contract.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001098)
When I return the IBN 5100 to Yanagigayashi Shrine--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A8)
The Ragnarok with SERN will be complete, and the fate of the world will have already been decided.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B8)
【Rintaro】And then, when the Ragnarok completes, be it in victory, or be it in defeat, my life as Hououin Kyouma will already be--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C8)
【Rintaro】Wait, please forget what I just said. This isn't the time to be thinking that far into the future. That's right, the future...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E2)
【Moeka】...? More importantly, where
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F2)
Geez... I even said it with conviction. She just can't read the atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001102)
【Rintaro】The IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001278)
With perfect timing, I hear the sound of the door opening from the lounge. Moeka twitches.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129A)
I take a look and see Daru, wiping the sweat off his brow with a towel as he comes in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137A)
【Itaru】...Guten Morgen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138A)
【Rintaro】You sure are early.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139A)
Ever since university entered summer break, Daru has been coming to the lab in the morning less and less.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AA)
But then again, he's also been staying up all night more and more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BA)
【Itaru】Because yesterday, I went to bed at dusk. I woke up at five this morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
【Itaru】Hah-, it's hot-. It's just too unbelievable for it to be this hot in the morning, durr.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EE)
【Itaru】Oh? Ohh? Okarin, that erot... sexy 3D woman over there, who might she be?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001436)
【Rintaro】Ah, let me introduce you. She's Shining Finger Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001446)
【Itaru】Shining... Finger... you say? Does she yell "This hand of mine glows"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001456)
【Rintaro】She doesn't. But she has an ability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001470)
【Itaru】Wha, ability... no way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001480)
【Rintaro】You'll get it when you see it. She unmistakeably has an ability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000149A)
【Itaru】Well, whatever. Welcome, Kiryuu-shi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014AA)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014BA)
Even though Daru bowed his head, Moeka doesn't so much as look at him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014CA)
She's now-- or rather, always-- looking down on at her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014DA)
That behavior causes Daru to blush.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F8)
【Itaru】...Wh-what magnificent ignoring skill. Are you looking down on me because I'm an ota fatass?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151A)
 Dammit, don't tell me you're a <DICT>mainstream woman</DICT> too!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152E)
【Rintaro】Umm, Moeka, this man is my dependable right arm, Supah Hakah Daru--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153E)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000154E)
Moeka pulls her chin back so slightly I can't tell if she bowed her head or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000155E)
Her expression didn't change at all. Everything about Daru flows cleanly through one ear and out the other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156E)
Even though she was so eager to meet the supah hakah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001588)
【Itaru】Okarin, don't tell she's done something dangerous?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001598)
【Rintaro】Dangerous as in what? She just photographed us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B2)
【Itaru】Photograph... you say...? She's going to blackmail us and then finally turn us into sex toys...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C2)
【Rintaro】Stop applying your eroge brain to reality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DC)
【Itaru】My bad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EC)
Daru just adds to the trouble, saying that sort of drivel in front of the person in question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001612)
【Itaru】Ah, yeah. I thought up some improvements to the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001622)
【Rintaro】Improvements? Where?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001632)
【Itaru】Look, now we need to do an annoying procedure. Just to send D-mails into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001642)
【Rintaro】Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165C)
【Itaru】I want to make it simpler. Ah, and also make it possible to forward from the Microwave Ophone's dedicated phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166C)
【Rintaro】Forward? What exactly do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167C)
【Itaru】Right now, you can only send a D-mail to the phone attached to the Microwave Ophone, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168C)
That's right. In yesterday's experiments, my phone was attached to the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s socket, so my inbox got flooded with D-mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A6)
【Itaru】That's pretty inconvenient. If we give the Microwave Ophone's dedicated phone a forwarding function, then we can send D-mails to any number by means of that phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B6)
【Rintaro】How long will improvement take?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D0)
【Itaru】Two or three hours, I guess? That's if you help me, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E0)
【Rintaro】Understood. I'll help.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F0)
【Itaru】OK.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001700)
Daru really is reliable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001718)
I walk near Daru, ceremoniously raising my hand for a high five.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001734)
But he completely ignores it, sits on the sofa, and begins eating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001744)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175C)
Dammit! Pay attention, Daru!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176C)
I slowly lower my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177C)
W-whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178C)
Once the improvements are complete, we'll gather the lab mems and begin discussing serious D-mail use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179C)
We did nothing but experiments yesterday, but it's time to think more about what we can do by sending mail into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000183E)
...Another mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185C)
I have the choice to look or to not look, but the ringtone pressures me to look. It's far more irritating than normal conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187A)
Moeka's reticent and inconspicuous existence could, in some sense, be due to her acquired worldly wisdom, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A4)
How careless...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019B4)
Daru, you idiot, you made such a basic mistake!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A9C)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AAC)
Moeka makes eye contact with me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ABC)
With her eyes that always looked at nothing but her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACC)
She's staring straight at me now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B4C)
I ignore her and go back to the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B5C)
【Rintaro】If you want to say something, then say it verba--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6C)
My lose my breath mid-sentence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC0)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD0)
Unusual for her, Moeka turns her eyes towards me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE0)
Usually, she'd only look at her phone display.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF0)
【Moeka】...Look at the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C00)
I didn't expect her to be so serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C10)
【Rintaro】Verbally--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2A)
【Moeka】"Sending mail to the past."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C3A)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4A)
【Moeka】You guys said that just now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5A)
【Moeka】...tell me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C6A)
How careless...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7A)
Daru, you idiot, you made such a basic mistake!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8E)
I need to talk my way out of this somehow...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D2C)
It's just part-time, but she works for the mass media.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3C)
If she finds out that the first time machine in human history is here, it'll spread to the entire world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4C)
And then the Organization would know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5C)
That alone must be stopped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC0)
【Rintaro】You misheard us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD0)
【Moeka】No.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE0)
Moeka shakes her head side to side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF0)
【Moeka】I heard it clearly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E00)
Moeka's pretty persistent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E10)
I know that because of all her mail attacks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E20)
She won't let me escape so easily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E30)
Just what should I do...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E6E)
I grind my teeth and put my phone to my right ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E7E)
【Rintaro】It's me. Things have gone bad. ...No, not that. Information on the 8th machine got leaked to a third party. ...Yeah, I know. I need to do something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E8E)
【Rintaro】
...Depending on the situation, I may need to silence her. ...Yeah, I know, we can't let the 'Organization' know about this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E9E)
【Rintaro】If this is Steins;Gate's choice, then it's too much, isn't it? ...Hmph, don't worry. I'll have plenty of time to go to hell after the Operation "Ragnarok".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EAE)
【Rintaro】El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EFC)
I put my phone in my pocket, and turn back to Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F0C)
【Moeka】...Who was on the phone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F1C)
【Rintaro】Doesn't concern you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F36)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F46)
Moeka hangs her head. She starts another mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC8)
What's with this code?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD8)
Since she didn't include her usual signature, does that mean she was in a hurry? Her expression didn't change at all, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FEE)
Anyway, I disregard the mail's contents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020CC)
I take one step towards Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DC)
Moeka makes no attempt to escape.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020EC)
She has no path of retreat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020FC)
【Rintaro】Choose. Swear to protect our secret... or death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000210C)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000211C)
【Rintaro】
Right now. No grace period. No alternatives either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000212C)
【Rintaro】You know our lab's secret, so prepare yourself for the worst, Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002146)
【Moeka】...You'll kill me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002156)
【Rintaro】Only if you try to publish the truth.... Underestimating me, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, is not--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002166)
【Itaru】What? Okarin, are you at it again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002176)
Before I realized it, Daru was standing behind me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002186)
I turn around in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022AA)
【Itaru】Umm, Kiryuu-shi, was it? Okarin's got that sort of illness, so it's OK to just ignore him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C4)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D4)
Can't you read the atmosphere, Supah Hakah-!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E4)
【Rintaro】Imbecile! Because of your careless words, she found out that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) can function as a time machine!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022FE)
【Moeka】...! Time machine...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002318)
【Itaru】Just now, Okarin, you said some careless words too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002328)
【Rintaro】Ugh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002338)
No good, everything that could go wrong, has.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002348)
How can I recover from this situation!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002358)
To silence Moeka about this secret--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023CE)
【Mayuri】Tutturu-♪ Good morning-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023DE)
【Mayuri】Ah, Okarin, before the time machine experiments, Mayushii wants to warm up some karaage-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002454)
Heartbroken, I genuflect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002464)
This is no good. It's impossible to talk my way out of this one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002474)
【Rintaro】Kiryuu Moeka. I'll tell you everything... And I have a favor to ask.
