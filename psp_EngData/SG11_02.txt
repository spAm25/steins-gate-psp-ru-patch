#WRITE(PTR, $000009E0)
It's surprisingly narrow inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F0)
I sit face to face with Suzuha in the cylindrical interior.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A00)
Almost like an amusement park attraction, like the teacup or a Ferris wheel gondola.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A10)
The circumference of the cylinder was slightly higher than the floor, suitable for sitting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A20)
The number of buttons was astonishingly small.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A30)
I also saw the interior of α World Line Suzuha's time machine, but this one gives the impression of more refinement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A40)
However, the current time machine's time display panel is the same as the α World Line's: black with red letters. Maybe that's just Daru's taste.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAE)
【Suzuha】Give me your phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD2)
I hand over my phone as asked, and for some reason, Suzuha opens up the hatch and chucks it outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE2)
【Rintaro】H-hey!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF2)
【Suzuha】It's best you not bring it. It'll cause crosstalk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B02)
...Crosstalk?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B12)
Oh, I see. Since we're going to July 28, there will be two of me, and, if I bring it, two of my phones.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B22)
Things could get troublesome if I got a call or something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B32)
So time travelers really do need to be careful about what they bring into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B42)
【Suzuha】Close the hatch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B52)
I hear Mayuri and Daru's cheers from outside. Mayuri caught my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B62)
I nod back to them one last time, and close the hatch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B72)
We're wrapped in stillness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE0)
Suzuha is operating the time display panel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF0)
Our time travel destination is July 28, 2010 at 11:50.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C00)
【Suzuha】This time should be about right, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C10)
【Rintaro】Isn't that cutting it a little close?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C20)
I remember Doctor Nakabachi's presentation began at 12.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C30)
【Suzuha】This time machine can't move physically.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C40)
【Rintaro】Meaning?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C50)
【Suzuha】Basically, if we were to time travel here from the Radio Kaikan's rooftop, no matter what time we travel to, we'll arrive at the same coordinates of the rooftop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C60)
【Suzuha】Well, actually, there's a lot more complex calculations involved, but let's not get into that now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C70)
【Suzuha】We can leap to the day before the presentation, it'll be bad if it gets canceled due to our actions, right? That's why it's best to cut it close.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C80)
【Rintaro】I see...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEE)
【Suzuha】Uncle, is this your first time time traveling?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFE)
【Rintaro】First, stop calling me Uncle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0E)
【Rintaro】I've time leaped so much I'm sick of it, but this is my first time time traveling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1E)
【Rintaro】According to John Titor, you're subjected to a fairly large G-force, giving the sensation of being stretched out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2E)
【Suzuha】Yeah I wrote that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3E)
【Rintaro】The John Titor stuff?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4E)
【Suzuha】Right. When I leapt to 2000.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5E)
【Rintaro】I see...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6E)
The past changed. Or, I should say, changed back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7E)
In the α World Line, I witnessed Titor's 2010 posts on @channel in real time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8E)
【Suzuha】Don't be so surprised, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9E)
These past few minutes, so much information has come into my head at once, it seems it's gonna blow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAE)
I no longer have the capacity to be surprised.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBE)
【Suzuha】I'll explain this mission again, okay? Because we'll have no time to talk leisurely on the other side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCE)
【Suzuha】The objective is the avoidance of Makise Kurisu's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F08)
Ever since I returned to this world line, I've intentionally avoided news of Kurisu's incident.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F18)
I was afraid it would decide the result.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F28)
So at this point in time, I don't know who killed Kurisu. I don't know how or why she died. I don't know at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F38)
If I knew things would turn out like this, maybe I should have looked things up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F48)
As soon as I asked myself this, I denied it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEE)
【Rintaro】...what about attractor field convergence?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
【Suzuha】Didn't I say so already? That day is a turning point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106C)
【Suzuha】The possibility of Makise Kurisu's death is roughly calculated as 50％.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107C)
【Rintaro】So, it won't converge?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108C)
【Suzuha】It may or may not. No, it probably will. But I'm sure there's a loophole somewhere. That loophole itself is the entrance to the "Steins;Gate".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109C)
So in the end, it's a game...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000110A)
【Suzuha】And one piece of advice. Be careful of Doctor Nakabachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111A)
【Rintaro】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000112A)
【Suzuha】I told you that in my 2036, World War III broke out, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000113A)
【Suzuha】If you trace its cause to the source, you arrive at the "Nakabachi Thesis". Doctor Nakabachi wrote documents concerning the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000114A)
【Rintaro】But that bastard just ripped his time travel theory off of John Titor...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000115A)
...wait, John Titor is sitting here in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000116A)
【Rintaro】Ah, so... what Titor posted on the net... was true?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117A)
【Suzuha】I mixed in some lies, so not many people listened to me at the time I posted it, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118A)
【Suzuha】I never thought it would be reevaluated 10 years later. It looks like he built his theory off of the one I wrote. It seems its level of completeness is high.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000119A)
【Suzuha】Anyway, Doctor Nakabachi was there in the assembly hall where Makise Kurisu was killed, right? He should also be a key figure in large world line divergence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AA)
That Doctor Nakabachi is...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BA)
I thought he was just some suspicious old guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CA)
【Suzuha】...so, ready to go? Fasten your seatbelt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DA)
Now that I look underneath me, I do indeed see something resembling a car seatbelt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011EA)
I wrap that around my waist, fixing my body to the seat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011FA)
【Rintaro】Does it shake a lot?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000120A)
【Suzuha】It rarely -shakes-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121A)
So that means it does stuff other than shake?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000122A)
Woah, hold on, will I be okay...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001298)
Suzuha bends forward and pushes a conspicuous yellow button on the bottom of the panel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B4)
I can't see the outside, so I can't even tell if the time machine is moving at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C4)
【Suzuha】It's only three weeks, so it shouldn't take more than two or three minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D4)
Suzuha fastens her own seatbelt and sighs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E4)
【Suzuha】When I first leapt to 1975, it was six long hours with nothing to do and nothing I could do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F4)
Time travelers have their own problems it seems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001304)
【Suzuha】It's only two or three minutes, so I won't put on an oxygen mask, but for the duration of the time travel, there won't be any oxygen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001314)
【Rintaro】You can put up with that!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001374)
【Suzuha】Here--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001384)
Suzuha points to the center of the cylinder-- the space between me and her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001394)
【Suzuha】An air pocket forms. If you stick your head in there, you can breathe for about 10 minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A4)
【Rintaro】Hey, for argument's sake, if we fail to save Kurisu... what happens?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B4)
【Suzuha】To be honest, we don't have much fuel. Barely enough fuel was put in in the first place. There's not even enough for me to get back to 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C4)
【Suzuha】In other words, if we fail to change the world line, then I'm stuck in this era.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
【Suzuha】Ah, but don't worry. If it's just going back and forth from August 20 and July 28, we can still do two round trips.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
...Conversely, that means we only have two chances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F4)
【Rintaro】If you don't have enough fuel, then how do you plan to get back to 2036?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001404)
【Suzuha】I don't plan to go back. If we reach the "Steins;Gate", then I'd no longer have a reason to time travel, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001414)
【Suzuha】Cause and effect will be reconfigured. The me sitting here will disappear, since I'd probably be living peacefully in 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001424)
【Suzuha】But that all depends on you, Uncle Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001434)
Her tone is light, but her face is serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001444)
...It's been so long since I've talked to her, but I just now noticed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001454)
The woman known as Suzuha acts without considering the consequences.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001658)
At that moment, along with a sound like a burst of air, countless faint silver lights start floating throughout the cylinder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001668)
Just like insect scales. Or powder snow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001678)
The silver lights gradually change color.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001688)
Violet. Blue. Green. Yellow. Orange. Red. Back to silver. Violet. Blue--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001698)
Is this a rainbow?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A8)
I feel pressure throughout my whole body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B8)
Similar to the sensation of going up in an elevator.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C8)
It's like the feeling of the elevator pulling you downwards, but the time machine pulls horizontally at my back instead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D8)
The feeling of pressure gradually strengthens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E8)
The sense of falling sideways. I've never experienced this before. It's so uncomfortable, I want to cry out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F8)
The time machine doesn't shake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001708)
It's startlingly peaceful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001718)
Enough that I begin to question whether it's really moving at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001728)
It was eerie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001738)
The pulling sensation grows even stronger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001748)
The feeling of pressure crushing my body starts to seem like an illusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001758)
My own body, my own bones, start to creak.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001768)
【Rintaro】Guh...uh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001778)
This isn't on the same level as an elevator at all...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001788)
This is almost like when astronauts blast off into space in a space shuttle, isn't it...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001798)
When I look at Suzuha, she has her eyes shut tight, bearing the pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A8)
Her back is pressed to the cylinder's outer wall, not letting go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B8)
My vision distorts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C8)
Within my distorting vision, the powder of light is still revolving colors like a rainbow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D8)
Wondrous, and divine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E8)
I'm still falling--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F8)
Horizontally? Into a space-time tunnel?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001808)
Anyway, I'm falling--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001818)
My body doesn't seem to work.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F6)
My field of vision suddenly turns pitch black.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001906)
I shouted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001916)
My voice also falls behind my back, not even reaching my own ears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001926)
Gravity. There's an intense gravitational distortion behind my back.--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001936)
I just keep falling towards it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC8)
The smell of ozone reaches my nose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD8)
My vision returns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE8)
Suzuha takes a deep breath and unfastens her seatbelt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF8)
【Suzuha】We're here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D08)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D18)
I try to catch my breath in gulps.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D28)
Did I really time travel just now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D38)
July 28.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D54)
The day Kurisu and I first met.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D64)
The day I first sent a D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D74)
I've returned... to that fateful day...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D84)
Suzuha takes out a digital watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D94)
Its design is extremely old.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA4)
【Suzuha】I bought it in 1975. But it's only been used for three years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB4)
This is where an uninformed person would say "In Japanese plz".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC4)
After spinning the dial to set it to the correct time, she hands it to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD4)
The watch indicates 11:51.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE4)
Nakabachi's presentation starts at 12.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF4)
【Suzuha】We're going okay? Uncle Okarin, mark out Makise Kurisu, and obstruct whatever it is that kills her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E04)
【Rintaro】What about you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E14)
【Suzuha】I'll support you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E24)
【Suzuha】This is related to why I took away your phone, but the Uncle Okarin of July 28 is also here. Meaning now, there exist two Okabe Rintaros in this world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E34)
【Suzuha】Okay? You must absolutely avoid contacting yourself. You can't do that. You'll create a time paradox.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E44)
【Rintaro】But that's not what Titor said--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E54)
【Suzuha】That was just fake information.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E64)
Now that she mentions it, α World Line Suzuha said the stuff about the many worlds interpretation was also fake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E74)
【Rintaro】...Understood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E84)
【Suzuha】Then let's begin. When it's over, meet me at the time machine!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA0)
Suzuha gives a hurried explanation, urging me to get out first.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB0)
I open the hatch and reach outside--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F24)
I squeeze my way out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6C)
Suzuha crawls out after me and closes the hatch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F86)
【Suzuha】Hide, Uncle! I'll distract them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA2)
Suzuha immediately runs to the fire door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB2)
And surprisingly takes out her gun, firing at the doorknob.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002028)
With the lock destroyed, the door easily opens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002038)
Very soon, several people should be coming to the rooftop to detain me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002048)
I need to hide myself before that...!
