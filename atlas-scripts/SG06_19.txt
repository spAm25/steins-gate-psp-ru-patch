When I provide the time machine repairman Daru with the refreshing gift of Dr Pepper, his sweaty face looks downhearted.

【至】
You're supposed to give me an ice cold zero calorie cola. Common sense, man...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
So he's a cola type of guy....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
No sense letting it go to waste. I drink the Dr Pepper myself.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000870)
Daru and Suzuha have a one-on-one discussion about the time machine's structure, while Mayuri and I watch from a distance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B8)
【まゆり】
Hey, hey, Okarin. That satellite was a time machine. What a surprise, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C8)
【倫太郎】
Yeah, sure was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D8)
Speaking of Titor's time machine, I thought it was a car-- a 1970's Chevy-- so I didn't even suspect that it was the satellite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E8)
You know what they say when you assume.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F8)
But if you think about it, an unidentified satellite falling from somewhere is blatantly suspicious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000908)
Titor's appearance on @channel was also almost right after the satellite fell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000918)
I'm disappointed in myself for not noticing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000932)
【まゆり】
It stuck into the building, but I'm glad that Suzu-san's safe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000942)
No, it's not like it crashed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000952)
Most likely, it appeared there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000962)
And then the surrounding wall scraped off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000972)
After all, the time machine isn't self-propelled. It doesn't fly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098C)
【まゆり】
She said it's really hard to drive-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099C)
Suzuha said that, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AC)
【まゆり】
If the gravitational whatchamacallit device gets the coordinates the slightest bit wrong, the whole time machine becomes a Jellyman and it goes all ploop ploop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BC)
【まゆり】
And since that time machine isn't made by SERN, she said it's not all that stable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D6)
【まゆり】
I'm worried about when she goes to 1975-....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
【まゆり】
If it's a two seater, then I could go with her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
【倫太郎】
What are you going to do if you go with her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A10)
【まゆり】
Obviously- I'd hold Suzu-san's hand super tightly, and tell her that it's okay since Mayushii's here, cheering her on-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A20)
She'd actually be useless baggage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3A)
【まゆり】
Hey, hey, Okarin, does that time machine have a name, you think-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
【倫太郎】
A name, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5A)
I obviously want to know more about the time machine from the future, not just its name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6A)
Time permitting, I'd like to spend a whole day just asking Suzuha questions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7A)
I'm pretty certain John Titor's time machine had a model number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8A)
But the one John Titor I know who appeared in 2000 and Suzuha might not be one and the same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9A)
In this current world line, John Titor didn't appear in 2000.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAA)
Though, there is the possibility that after Suzuha time travels to 1975, she'll drop by 2000.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABA)
【倫太郎】
If you're interested, then just ask Titor directly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD4)
【まゆり】
Ah, that's right-. Mayushii completely forgot. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6C)
And so, she optimistically rushes to Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0E)
She comes back quickly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1E)
【まゆり】
Yup. It has a name-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2E)
【倫太郎】
What sort of name?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C48)
【まゆり】
FG204 Something Something, she said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C58)
Something Something...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C72)
【まゆり】
Anyway, don't you think that Daru-kun and Suzu-san really match-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C82)
【倫太郎】
Haah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C92)
Today, Mayuri's conversation's jumping all over the place....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA2)
I look at Daru and Suzuha again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB2)
【倫太郎】
They match...? You know, Daru's a Faris moe kind of guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC2)
【まゆり】
Ah, I see-. Is that so?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD2)
She tilts her head to the side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE2)
Good grief....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF2)
Mayuri and I aren't of any use here, so I thought maybe we should leave it to them and restart the search for Suzuha's father and the pin badge, but Mayuri doesn't move at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D02)
We don't have any clues for either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D12)
Maybe it was impossible to find them in just two days....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D22)
I don't want to think that. Just like I told Suzuha, I don't want to give up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D32)
Besides, even if we don't find them, I can keep time leaping to repeat these two days until we finally find them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D42)
【倫太郎】
Oh yeah, Mayuri. What about your costume sewing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D52)
There's only a few more days until ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D62)
At this time, Mayuri should've been working overnight on making her costume, but there's no sign of that now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7C)
【まゆり】
Hm-? You know, I've already made two of them-. One for Kaede-chan and one for Fubuki-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8C)
【倫太郎】
Weren't you going to have Lukako wear the third one?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA6)
【まゆり】
Yeah, I was, but I couldn't persuade Luka-chan, so I gave up this time-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC0)
【まゆり】
Heyhey, can Mayushii get a better look at the time machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD0)
【倫太郎】
Don't get in their way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEA)
【まゆり】
Okidokey♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
Mayuri replies energetically as she rushes over to the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E16)
Like it's a field trip....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E26)
I can clearly see the sunlight sloping as the sun sinks from the rooftops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E36)
As the sunset fades into twilight, Suzuha stands beside me as if to change places with Mayuri. The setting sun stretches our shadows.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9C)
【鈴羽】
Hashida Itaru's amazing. With him working on the time machine at full speed, he said he might be able to fix it tomorrow if things go well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EAC)
【倫太郎】
Daru's ability is authentic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBC)
【鈴羽】
Even though he looks unhealthy and lackluster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECC)
【倫太郎】
Don't judge a book by its cover.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDC)
【鈴羽】
Yeah. I have a better impression now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEC)
【鈴羽】
Umm... you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFC)
【鈴羽】
If I don't say it now, I won't ever have another opportunity, so I'll say it now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0C)
【倫太郎】
What? Don't exaggerate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1C)
【鈴羽】
I'm actually really grateful for you all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2C)
【鈴羽】
When I fist came to this era, I didn't know anybody.... It's completely different from my era where I did nothing but fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3C)
【鈴羽】
This era is a lot more peaceful, so peaceful it really frightened me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4C)
【鈴羽】
But now I have friends... no, comrades, that I can expose all of myself to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5C)
【鈴羽】
I met people who lived before I was born, and everyone's working so hard for my sake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6C)
【鈴羽】
That makes me feel very strange... but also very happy, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7C)
【鈴羽】
Those are my true feelings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8C)
For some reason, Suzuha has a very serious expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9C)
I tried to talk, but Suzuha continues before I could.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
【鈴羽】
I was able to come to this era and spend time with all of you. It was really fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBC)
【鈴羽】
Or rather, every single one of you was selfish, had weird habits, and was too dense... actually, I thought 'what's with these guys?' at first.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCC)
【鈴羽】
But before I knew it, the times I spent with you all became fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
【鈴羽】
In 2036, everyone's too peaceful. There aren't any fights. Did you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
【倫太郎】
There's no way I could. I mean, I don't even live until 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFC)
【鈴羽】
Ahh, that's right.... Sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100C)
【鈴羽】
Anyway, there aren't any fights. Any disputes, from the micro to the macro level, have all completely disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101C)
【鈴羽】
But instead, everyone has dead eyes like fish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102C)
【鈴羽】
Nobody has any aspirations. They just shuffle their feet forward.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
【鈴羽】
People do smile, but they don't get angry or sad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
【鈴羽】
Nobody has any individuality. Everyone's like a robot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
【鈴羽】
Just before, you got really mad at me, didn't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106C)
【鈴羽】
Back then, it really surprised me. It was a big shock, but at the same time... I was really happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107C)
【倫太郎】
You're an oddball.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108C)
【鈴羽】
Ahaha. Certainly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109C)
Suzuha looks to the time machine. Right next to it, Daru and Mayuri are having an optimistic conversation about something or another.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AC)
【鈴羽】
Everyone in your lab is so lively... so radiant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010BC)
【鈴羽】
Shiina Mayuri and Hashida Itaru... and Makise Kurisu. And you, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CC)
【倫太郎】
...what foolishness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DC)
There's nothing admirable about my lifestyle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EC)
I'm always self-righteous even though I can't save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FC)
【鈴羽】
I wanted to be like you guys.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000110C)
【倫太郎】
Well, I think you're more amazing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111C)
【鈴羽】
I think I'm happy to hear that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000112C)
【鈴羽】
The reason I can work this hard is also because I met you guys.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000113C)
【鈴羽】
Being a lab mem for even just a little while... was great.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000114C)
Another serious smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000115C)
So serious she might cry at any moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000116C)
So serious she might break at any moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117C)
That smile, was so fragile──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001210)
【鈴羽】
Being with you guys for even just a little while... was great.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001220)
【倫太郎】
...Suzuha?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001230)
【鈴羽】
Okabe Rintaro. I'm sure you'll change the future. You'll change it into a world, free like the present.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001240)
【倫太郎】
Hey, what's wrong? Why are you so sentimental?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
Does she not want to go to 1975?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001260)
But I mean, with the time machine, can't she just come back afterwards?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001270)
And then, I notice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001280)
...Ah, I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001290)
If Suzuha were to get an IBN 5100 in 1975 and then come back here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A0)
At that instant, just like the D-mail experiments,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B0)
The world line will change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C0)
The future will be reorganized in accordance with the law of cause and effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D0)
Suzuha will never be able to return to her original 2036.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E0)
Even though she called it a cruel era.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F0)
That era was the era Suzuha had lived in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001300)
Suzuha probably has friends there too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001310)
The mementos left behind by her late father-- Barrel Titor-- are probably there too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001320)
If she changes the future, all those things will be lost to the Suzuha who changed the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001330)
Of course she'd be sentimental.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001340)
【倫太郎】
If the time machine gets fixed, let's have the party again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000135A)
【鈴羽】
...Yeah, thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000136A)
But the forced smile on Suzuha's face still doesn't disappear.
