Anyway, you're the one who mailed me to come here, right?

Indeed, it was I. But the one who faithfully abided by that mail and punctually arrived at the lab, was you.

It's not something to be worried about. That's just how Mayuri is.

Don't put that there. That's filthy.

I just washed them!

You say that, but you're still putting nuggets to your mouth....

D-mails have too much of an uncertain factor. As a result, they have no guarantee.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F80)
【紅莉栖】
There's no helping it, right? After all, you are entrusting the result to how the receiving party responds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F90)
【紅莉栖】
But conversely, if you can psychoanalyze the other party's character, you might be able to better manipulate them.

With that psychological element in mind, it might be impossible for Hououin Kyoumunderwear, though.

【至】
Makise-shi, do you just want to say underwear?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCA)
【倫太郎】
Putting underwear aside, it's a fact that D-mails still feel like a gamble.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDA)
I want more certainty so I can expose the conspiracies of the Organization and SERN, guiding chaos to the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEA)
【倫太郎】
And that, ladies and gentlemen gathered here today, is the fact of the matter. The topic of today's round table conference is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104E)
【至】
It's become another unexpected round table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105E)
【紅莉栖】
If you want a round-table conference that much, at least go buy a round table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106E)
【まゆり】
That's not it, Chris-chan. You know, Okarin said it before, but the round table exists in everyone's hearts-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107E)
【紅莉栖】
Mayuri-san, you're really a pure girl.... But you shouldn't take everything Okabe says seriously.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108E)
【まゆり】
Really-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000109E)
【倫太郎】
The definition of a round table doesn't matter now. More importantly, the topic--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AE)
【倫太郎】
Is that, instead of using D-mails, I want to explore for a solution to physical time travel like SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001172)
【紅莉栖】
Don't be ridiculous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001182)
Prompt answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001192)
And she's glaring at me even sharper than she did during the whole underwear thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A2)
【紅莉栖】
SERN's been using such large-scale equipment, for more than nine years, and yet they still haven't succeeded, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B2)
【紅莉栖】
It's not something we can possibly hope to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CC)
【まゆり】
You'll become a GelOkarin-. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011EE)
【至】
Doesn't that sound like <DICT>Gero Froggy</DICT>? Why'd they get popular, anyway?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001208)
【紅莉栖】
No, this isn't a laughing matter....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001218)
【倫太郎】
Isn't it too early to give up? Haven't we already succeeded with D-mail, a first in all of human history?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001232)
【至】
But we're not the first. SERN did it before us, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001296)
【倫太郎】
Human history's first time-crossing mail. We who have achieved it know not the meaning of the word 'impossible'!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A6)
【紅莉栖】
Such baseless confidence. Anyway, wasn't it just a coincidence that you could use D-mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B6)
【紅莉栖】
We still haven't figured out what replaces the lifter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C6)
【倫太郎】
Don't we just need to figure it out?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138A)
【紅莉栖】
It's all useless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139A)
【紅莉栖】
How do you deal with a problem that not even SERN can figure out?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AA)
【紅莉栖】
If you can't set the local field, then you won't know where you'll leap to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C4)
【至】
I'll pass on leaping into the nothingness of space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
Local field setting certainly is a troubling problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
If you can't tell where you'll leap, there's no meaning to time travel at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001448)
【倫太郎】
No, wait a sec.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001458)
【倫太郎】
D-mails don't have local field settings. Yet they still arrive at their destinations properly. How do you explain that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001468)
【紅莉栖】
...Now that you mention it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001478)
【至】
Doesn't it arrive properly since you set the mail address?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001488)
【紅莉栖】
Is that so...? I don't think a phone signal can be received from millions of kilometers away, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001498)
【まゆり】
Mayushii thinks that maybe the signals are somewhere that can't be reached-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151A)
I stare at my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001598)
【倫太郎】
Or maybe cellphones already have black holes and <DICT>white hole</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A8)
【紅莉栖】
You shouldn't speculate. You have zero basis for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
【倫太郎】
Is it possible that it forms a wormhole?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C8)
【紅莉栖】
No wormholes have ever been confirmed to exist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015D8)
I groan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015E8)
Kurisu and Daru say no more about this inexplicable situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F8)
Only Mayuri smiles. No doubt she doesn't understand and is just smiling for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001608)
【倫太郎】
In any case, the cold, hard truth is that D-mails arrive in the past. We're leading SERN in that regard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001618)
【倫太郎】
Now, for time travel, could we possibly apply the same mechanism as D-mails?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001628)
【至】
But with D-mails, you can only send 36 bytes + α of data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001638)
【至】
It's seriously impossible to just roll up a person and physically transfer them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001648)
SERN's probably having a hard time with that too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170C)
【紅莉栖】
If you want to become GelOkarin, I'm not stopping you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001726)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C4)
I get goosebumps when I recall the tragic fate of the researchers in the Jellyman's Report.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D4)
The ring singularity of a Kerr black hole. Super gravitational space-time distortion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E4)
If you can adjust the volume of electron injection from the lifter, you might be able to make the ring singularities naked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017F4)
But that adjustment is such a challenge that even SERN is having a hard time with it. Even if we do locate the lifter's replacement, it's not a problem we can solve quickly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001804)
Meaning that at present, we can only send a mere 35 bytes + α of data.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001814)
I wonder what size a human body is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182C)
I've got a feeling it's no less than an <DICT>exa</DICT> byte....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189A)
【紅莉栖】
It's best if we don't think about physical transfer for now. Even just data time travel is an amazing feat, so we should just be patient with that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AA)
Data time travel... huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190E)
【倫太郎】
That's a backwards utterance unthinkable for researchers who seek the truth of the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191E)
【紅莉栖】
I'm telling you to know your limits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192E)
【紅莉栖】
If you're going to seek the truth, you need to have the appropriate brains, equipment, and funding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193E)
【紅莉栖】
With such an impoverished circle, your high ambitions don't mean much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194E)
【紅莉栖】
I thought about it before, but we should bring the Microwave Ophone to a proper research institution and entrust it to a specialist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195E)
【紅莉栖】
Since SERN is keeping their time machine research top secret, if we just make an official announcement, it'll be helpful for the future of mankind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196E)
【倫太郎】
...If we make an official announcement, the 'Organization's' guys will become aware of my existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197E)
【紅莉栖】
You know...! I'm speaking seriously here. This isn't the time for jok--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198E)
【倫太郎】
And we've also hacked SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199E)
【倫太郎】
Those guys are a heartless bunch who'd go so far as to do human experimentation. And behind the scenes, a powerful political power crossing through national framework has been rearing its head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019AE)

If we officially announce the Microwave Ophone (Temp), we might be erased.

...Are you watching too many movies?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A82)

The name 'Committee of 300' appeared in actual SERN documents.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A9C)

Yeah, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AAC)
Kurisu's tone of voice weakens.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ABC)
【まゆり】
Mayushii's kinda scared-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACC)

If our hacking got found out, then we'd seriously get erased. I didn't make any mistakes that would give us away, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ADC)

Also, this is the most important problem, but--

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AEC)
I lower my voice, and look seriously at their three faces.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B50)

If we make an official announcement, we won't be able to send D-mails as we please anymore, right!?

Th-that reminds me, Daru. Did you make any progress on hacking into SERN?

He did say it would take a little time to learn IBN 5100 use, though.

I confirmed that Daru came to the lab every day, doing something with his computer.

His monitor was always displaying a program, and he would keep checking on it and tamper with it.

Yeah, right now I'm fishing through tons of SERN's data.

Even if I translated and read them all, it would take years. Whenever I found something important, I transferred it to Makise-shi though.

Well, basically, it's not something I can do.

What's the third stage?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023D2)
【倫太郎】
SERN's top secret, forbidden domain. Obviously, we're going to open up the darkness hidden inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E2)
【至】
In Japanese please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F2)
【倫太郎】
There's a database constructed of IBN 5100's, right? I'm asking if you've already commenced hacking there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002402)
Daru frowns at my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002412)
【至】
Yeah, I said that was impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002438)
【倫太郎】
Can't you do something as long as we have the IBN 5100!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002448)
【至】
I could. But conversely speaking, that's exactly why I can't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000250C)
【倫太郎】
Hmm...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025BC)
This feeling again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025CC)
The conversation isn't lining up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002630)
【倫太郎】
I got an IBN 5100, didn't I? You haven't touched it yet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000264A)
【至】
Huh? You got one? When?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000265A)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000266A)
Puzzled, I look at Kurisu and Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000267A)
Mayuri tilts her head with a puzzled look, like always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000268A)
Kurisu meets my glance and shrugs her shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A4)
【紅莉栖】
I never heard that you got one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026BE)
【倫太郎】
Impossible...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026CE)
That just can't be!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002744)
I step into the development room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002754)
The IBN 5100 I borrowed from Yanabayashi Shrine should be on the shelf inside. It's in a cardboard box, and it weighs 25 kg, a weight hard to carry by a single person--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002764)
【倫太郎】
...it's gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002774)
It doesn't exist where I thought I left it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B0)
【倫太郎】
...IBN 5100! I placed you right here. Where did you disappear to!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C0)
Everyone looks at me in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D0)
【倫太郎】
What's with those pigeon-potshot-with-peashooter faces!? The legendary PC dedicated at Yanabayashi Shrine!! You guys know about it, right!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E0)
【まゆり】
I don't know about it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FA)
【至】
Dedicated at Yanabayashi Shrine? That's retarded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002914)
【紅莉栖】
You sure you didn't hallucinate? It's hot these days.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002924)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C6)
I sink into helplessness like quicksand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D6)
Without the IBN 5100, we can't hack that database!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A74)
Just who did it? Who took it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A84)
The Organization? SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A94)
SERN is a possibility. Maybe they noticed our hacking and stole the IBN 5100 from the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA4)
No, no, no.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB4)
Even if they could steal the IBN 5100 from the lab, they can't steal Mayuri and Daru's memories of it...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC4)
Just what happened...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B8A)
Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BA8)
Maybe I should check Moeka right this instant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC6)
Someone besides Moeka could have taken it away....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE4)
I try considering that possibility.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C02)
そして浮かんだ名前は──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C20)
【倫太郎】
Don't tell me, John Titor!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C3E)
【倫太郎】
That's it, Titor's objective was to obtain an IBN 5100! I've already contacted him several times. But how did he get my personal information!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F16)
I sent that mail to Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F26)
I don't know if I'll get a response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F36)
Why am I sending her a mail like this in the first place...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F46)
The reason's obvious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F56)
I want to test that woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F66)
If it's an inside crime, then Moeka's the most suspicious one with her strange attachment to the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F76)
I wait a while, but no reply comes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F86)
Anyway, even if Moeka were the culprit, she wouldn't honestly admit it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FCE)
【紅莉栖】
Calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FE8)
【紅莉栖】
You don't have to arrange your thoughts, just slowly say whatever comes to mind. You can organize your thoughts later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FF8)
【倫太郎】
Ah, ahhh....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003008)
I wipe of my sweat with a handkerchief, and explain fundamental knowledge on the IBN 5100 and how I came to obtain one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000301C)
When I groan if I should send a mail, Kurisu chides me to calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000302C)
To be chided by a younger high school girl... you dare make a fool of Hououin Kyouma...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000303C)
Halfway serious, I explain fundamental knowledge on the IBN 5100 and how I came to obtain one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030DE)
During that time, I also send Moeka a confirmation mail.
