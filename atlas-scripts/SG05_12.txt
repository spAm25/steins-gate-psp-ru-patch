I try rubbing my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001FC)
It throbs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000020C)
Damn Mister Braun. Has he no shame in hitting me seriously?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000021C)
Maybe I should report him for assault.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000022C)
Furthermore, I'm compelled to perform a strategic withdrawal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000023C)
No, this is still part of the strategy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000024C)
A 10, 000 yen rent increase is tough, but in exchange, I've obtained important information in a form I'd never expect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000025C)
【倫太郎】
It's awwright in the end! Fuuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002FC)
【まゆり】
Okariin, the building just shook, but were things okay down there-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000030C)
Mayuri and Kurisu appear from the second story window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000031C)
【紅莉栖】
You really do revive like a undying phoenix.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032C)
【倫太郎】
Hehehe, Christina. Allow me to make a prediction. In three minutes, you will recognize my greatness and embrace feelings of respect!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033C)
【紅莉栖】
I don't think so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000034C)
I run up the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B0)
【紅莉栖】
...How could such an obvious thing go unnoticed until now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C0)
There's a possibility that the 42 in Braun tube TV downstairs is the lifter's replacement──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D0)
After I told that to Kurisu, that was her first response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E0)
【倫太郎】
Why are you blaming me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FA)
【紅莉栖】
...I'm not blaming you. I'm just disappointed at the stupidity that nobody noticed, including me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000542)
【至】
We missed the forest for the trees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000552)
【倫太郎】
In summary──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000562)
【倫太郎】
Just now, when the Microwave Ophone (Temp) on the second floor shook the building, the 42in Braun tube TV was on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000572)
【倫太郎】
But when the TV was turned off, the shaking stopped at the same time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000058C)
【紅莉栖】
The discharge phenomenon was forcefully interrupted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000059C)
【紅莉栖】
Just to make sure, I put a banana in, but it didn't turn into a Jellyman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E4)
【まゆり】
I think that's a good thing-. It's not good to waste food-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F4)
Nobody answers Mayuri's missing-the-point statement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000604)
When we look up the structure of a Braun tube on the net, we find out something interesting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000061C)
Braun tubes use an inner component called an "electron gun" to superheat electrons, or emit them through a high <DICT>electric field</DICT>, accelerate them, and converge them into a beam.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000062C)
Those electrons scan onto the display's phosphor layer to emit light. That's how they're structured.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000063C)
Thus, it seems appropriate as the replacement for the lifter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000656)
【紅莉栖】
We've found an answer, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000666)
【紅莉栖】
The electrons emitted by the 42in Braun tube TV interfere with the singular points produced by the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000676)
【紅莉栖】
The discharge phenomenon is an effect of that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000690)
【至】
The reason we couldn't use the Microwave Ophone at night was because that's when the Braun Tube Workshop's closed, then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006A0)
The Braun Tube Workshop doesn't have especially strict business hours, but it's usually open from around 11AM to 7PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B0)
The Microwave Ophone (Temp) time rule I came up with-- we can use it about noon to six-- matches up perfectly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C0)
Whenever we abruptly couldn't use it during those times can simply be explained with the fact that the 42in Braun tube TV just wasn't on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D0)
【倫太郎】
But I don't think a Braun tube emits electrons that strong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EA)
【紅莉栖】
It's not like the strength of the electrons is all that matters. If it were that simple, SERN would've solved this problem long ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FA)
I see. So it can't be too much or too little either, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070A)
The strict value was unknown until now, and just by chance, it happened to match the 42in Braun tube's electron emission "ratio"──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071A)
It's reasonable to think of it like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000734)
【紅莉栖】
They coincidentally match perfectly. The conditions here were miraculously perfect to create a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000744)
【倫太郎】
No, that's not it, Christina!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000754)
【倫太郎】
Everything is Steins;Gate's choice!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076E)
Kurisu gives an unusual wry smile at my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077E)
【紅莉栖】
It doesn't really matter what it is, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000798)
【まゆり】
Umm-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A8)
Mayuri halts her costume making and tilts her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007C2)
【まゆり】
So, basically, what do we have to do to complete Super Microwave Ophone-chan-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007DC)
【紅莉栖】
Since we've found the cause, we have nothing left to fear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EC)
【紅莉栖】
We've come to the solution that time leaping is possible whenever that large Braun tube TV is on... I think.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000806)
【至】
Since that final adjustment got interrupted, don't we need to do another experiment?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000820)
【紅莉栖】
That's right. Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000830)
【倫太郎】
What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000840)
【紅莉栖】
Go downstairs again and turn on that Braun tube TV.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000850)
【倫太郎】
Fuhaha, oh, Christina. That's a really funny joke. I respond to that with──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000866)
【倫太郎】
Mission: Unpossible!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000882)
Like hell I can!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000892)
The top of my head's still throbbing!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A2)
I can't even play the Mission: Unpossible theme in my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B2)
That's an endless death flag!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008CC)
【紅莉栖】
Whatever, just go already.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DC)
Kurisu orders me with a sour look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008EC)
It's like I'm the assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008FC)
【紅莉栖】
If anyone can do it, it's you. You made an amazing discovery just now, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090C)
【倫太郎】
Assistant, have you... recognized my greatness as a mad scientist?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000926)
【紅莉栖】
Nope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000936)
【倫太郎】
Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000950)
【至】
Gack, denied....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000096A)
【紅莉栖】
Ah, crap, if I'm flattering him so he'd do his best, I should've said 'Yes'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000984)
【紅莉栖】
So with that said, Yes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000994)
【倫太郎】
You're late!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AE)
【紅莉栖】
Now that we've found the device substituting the lifter, the Time Leap Machine is 99% complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BE)
Kurisu suddenly tightens her expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009CE)
But those eyes were gleaming ablaze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009DE)
She's a true seeker, through and through.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009EE)
She seems excited that the completion of the first Time Leap Machine in human history is at hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009FE)
Looking closely, her face is slightly flushed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A0E)
【紅莉栖】
Isn't it this lab's dream? The time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1E)
Our dream... huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2E)
I wasn't particularly aware of it, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3E)
I'm definitely interested too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4E)
My fingers are shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5E)
Not from fear of Manager, but from excitement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6E)
【倫太郎】
My dream is to manipulate space-time at will, and destroy the current ruling structures. And then, for new chaos to──
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A88)
【紅莉栖】
Okabe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A98)
Kurisu interrupts my words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA8)
【紅莉栖】
I don't want to hear Hououin's opinion, but Okabe's.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC8)
【紅莉栖】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AD8)
She stares motionlessly at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE8)
I take her gaze head on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF8)
I spontaneously smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B08)
【倫太郎】
Bring it on. Just leave everything to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B18)
I inform her so and head to the entranceway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B28)
I should ready myself for two more fists and another 10, 000 yen rent increase.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4A)
Kurisu and Daru send me off with applause for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5A)
Mayuri's the only one who looks worried, but I pat her delicate shoulders to relieve her.
<FILEEND32>
