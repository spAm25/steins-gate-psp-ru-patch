#WRITE(PTR, $000001E8)
I sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, spacing out as I stare at the night sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000001F8)
I try sorting out what happened this afternoon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000208)
But it's impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000218)
The more I think about it, the more complicated it gets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000290)
And so I hear footsteps coming down from the second floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000332)
When I try peeking, I see Mayuri and Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A8)
【倫太郎】
Going home?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B8)
【まゆり】
Yup.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C8)
【紅莉栖】
Okabe, do you always stay here overnight?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003D8)
【倫太郎】
I guess. Since I'm a mad scientist, I must be able to stay overnight at a research institution, immersed in research, or I'm unqualified.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F2)
【紅莉栖】
I think you're putting too much emphasis on appearance, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000402)
【まゆり】
But you know, this place is really convenient, right-. Mayushii wants to stay over here if mom and dad will let her-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041C)
【紅莉栖】
Eh, really...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000436)
【まゆり】
And then I can get to work quickly♪ Hey, hey, Chris-chan, next time, why don't we all stay over?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000450)
【紅莉栖】
If the male forces aren't around, then OK.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000460)
【倫太郎】
That's impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047A)
【紅莉栖】
Then, Mayuri-san, how about you come to my hotel?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000494)
【まゆり】
Ah, that reminds me, we did make that promise, huh-. Ehhehe-, then allow me to intrude next time, okay♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004AE)
【紅莉栖】
You can come whenever you like. Well then...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004CA)
Kurisu waves her hand, walking in the opposite direction from Akihabara Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A0)
Mayuri doesn't move from that spot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B0)
Instead, she does her usual habit-- Stardust Shakehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C0)
Looking up to the night sky, she raises her hand as if to grasp the stars.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D0)
And with good timing, a shooting star crosses through the night sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E0)
【まゆり】
...Hey, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F0)
【倫太郎】
Yeah. A shooting star. Made your wish?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000600)
Mayuri doesn't answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000610)
She keeps looking up to the sky--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000620)
【まゆり】
Okarin, back in elementary school, you got a terrible fever and stayed in bed for a month, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000630)
【倫太郎】
Why bring this up so suddenly?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006CE)
I certainly did have that experience.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006DE)
That was about 10 years ago. At the turn of the century, when the world was in an uproar about the year 2000 problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006EE)
Near the end of 1999 until New Years Day 2000, I had a nearly 40 degree fever for about a month.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FE)
Or so it seems. I don't have memories of it myself. According to my parents, I was unconscious the whole time, having nightmares. The doctors said it was a miracle I didn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000070E)
Because of that fever, I didn't get to experience the once in a thousand year millennium countdown event.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000071E)
By the way, the cause of that fever was unknown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000782)
【まゆり】
Back then, Mayushii was so afraid that Okarin might've died-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000792)
【まゆり】
So Granny and I wished to the sky together. 'Okarin, don't die'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A2)
【倫太郎】
Hehehe, it's impossible for me to die! After all, ten years ago, I was a mad scientist with an IQ of 170, equaling that of Thomas Edison!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007B2)
I'm not sure if Edison had an IQ of 170, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007CC)
【まゆり】
Heeh, is that so-. Okarin's amazing, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E6)
【まゆり】
But you know, Mayushii was still itty bitty, so she didn't know, and wished to the sky--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F6)
【まゆり】
But on New Year's eve, right before the calendar change, a shooting star went pewww across the sky. Just like now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000810)
【まゆり】
You know, if you repeat your wish three times before the shooting star disappears, your wish will come true, right-? Did you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000820)
Of course. That's not even trivia, but the most common of common knowledge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000083A)
【まゆり】
of course, Mayushii repeated her wish three times for dear life.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
Then Mayuri finally lowers her hand and turns to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000864)
On her face is a fleeting smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000874)
【まゆり】
The next day, on New Years, Okarin's fever went down, and he woke up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088E)
【まゆり】
So basically, Mayushii is Okarin's lifesaver-. Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089E)
【倫太郎】
No, that's not it. What saved me from that circumstance was Steins;Gate's choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B8)
【まゆり】
Ehh-? Really-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C8)
【倫太郎】
Really.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E2)
【まゆり】
I see-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F2)
Mayuri looks a little disappointed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090C)
【まゆり】
Hey, hey. Okarin, when your fever went down, you said this, remember?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091C)
【まゆり】
My vision's all gooey, I can't stand cause I'm all dizzy, and my body's all twitchy.'
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092C)
【倫太郎】
......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093C)
【まゆり】
Okarin, just a while ago, you felt the same thing, didn't you-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000094C)
【まゆり】
Are you okay...? You won't get a fever and collapse again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000095C)
Mayuri's asking with a really anxious face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000096C)
Looks like she got worried at my unrest over Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000097C)
Geez. For my hostage to worry about me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098C)
I unintentionally smile wryly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099C)
【倫太郎】
No worries. Don't worry about a thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B8)
I shrug as I give this answer and recall what happened ten years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C8)
When I woke up from that fever, the first thing that flew into my eyes was Mayuri's crying face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D8)
That's right. Certainly, back then, when I heard about how I had collapsed with a fever, I think I did say something like what Mayuri said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E8)
And now when I recall it, it does seem to match well with that sensation I felt a few hours ago, Reading Steiner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F8)
【倫太郎】
I see, so this demon eye of mine already dwelled in my body back then, huh...! Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A08)
So basically, that's the answer, Steins;Gate's choice!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A18)
I really was born with this ability!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A28)
This ability that even convinced John Titor I was the Messiah!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A38)
Laughing loudly, I was convinced of it.
<FILEEND35>
