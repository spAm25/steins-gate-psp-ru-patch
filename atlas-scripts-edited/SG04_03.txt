We immediately started the D-mail experiment, and even though it's before noon, the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s discharge phenomenon still broke out.

Things look favorable today.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000664)
By the way, we haven't talked to Manager downstairs yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000674)
Maybe we should think of an excuse beforehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000684)
But this isn't the time to read the owner's expression.

Correct, for this is the war against the Organization, otherwise known as SERN, and their conspiracy controlling the world from the shadows!

【Itaru】<DICT>Anzai-sensei</DICT>, I-I want to eat Faris-tan's home cooking...

【Mayuri】If you give up, it's game over you know-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A82)
Even with Daru's second D-mail, the past didn't change.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B26)
I feel like RaiNet matches are difficult to cheat your way out of in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCA)
Not to mention we're limited to 36 bytes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6E)
Looks like we'll have to give up on Daru, who's started to sulkily surf the net.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D12)
But even if we were to use another lab mem as a test subject, it doesn't look like Kurisu would bend her policy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB6)
Meaning there's only one candidate left.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF2)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, let's have you change the past next.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA0)
【Mayuri】Eh-? Mayushii? It's okay to change it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104E)
【Mayuri】But changing the past... what should I change about it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001104)
Mayuri looks stumped as she slurps her cup ramen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001126)
【Mayuri】Ah, then, how about this-? I'll change the past and have Luka-kun wear Mayushii's costume.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001136)
【Rintaro】How?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001150)
【Mayuri】By sending Luka-kun a mail-♪ Ehhehe-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001160)
That's not changing the past, but just a wish, isn't it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001170)
【Rintaro】You can't think of something more simple, and easy to understand?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000118A)
【Mayuri】Hm~mm~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000119A)
She slurps more ramen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011AE)
【Rintaro】...Let's use that cup ramen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BE)
Looks like only I can come up with ideas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CE)
【Rintaro】We'll send a D-mail to Mayuri one hour back. I wanna eat cup oden or so.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
【Kurisu】I don't think that's simple enough to convince her to--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001230)
【Mayuri】Ah, that might be really good-☆
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000124A)
【Kurisu】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001268)
【Mayuri】Today, when I was in front of the vending machine, I couldn't decide for about ten minutes-.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001282)
 Should I go with cup oden-, or
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129C)
 should I go with cup ramen-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B0)
【Rintaro】Basically, if she was pushed a little, Mayuri would inevitably want to eat cup oden, right!? Alright, let's go with that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CA)
【Mayuri】Yup, okay-. Well then, before we change the past, I gotta eat all this ramen first-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DA)
Then Mayuri starts eating the ramen for dear life.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F4)
【Kurisu】What's wrong with not eating it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001304)
【Mayuri】That'll be a waste♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001318)
【Kurisu】Ah, I, I see.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001332)
 That's right... ahaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001346)
Mayuri answers while smiling. Kurisu's face goes stiff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000135E)
She really is a <DICT>dumb girl</DICT>. This isn't the first time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
The D-mail preparations are set.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
The contents of Mayuri's mail are simple enough.

%LC"Cup oden is:"<LINE>
"Piping hot &"<LINE>
"Delicious!!!"

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C6)
Now we just pray that Mayuri will be inclined to choose cup oden.%
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001522)
We wait for Mayuri to finish eating her cup ramen and activate the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001532)
To send it one hour back, we set the timer to 1#. In other words, we set the microwave for only one second.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001542)
I wonder if the discharge phenomenon will occur in that small time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001552)
This is another first challenge for this experiment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001562)
【Rintaro】Microwave Ophone (Temp), activate!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001638)
【Mayuri】Aah, the mail still hasn't sent-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001648)
There wasn't enough time to blink, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175E)
【Kurisu】So the discharge phenomenon won't occur with just one second, huh. It might just be data, but that's still good to know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176E)
【Itaru】What if you try warming it up beforehand?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001788)
【Kurisu】Warming it up?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001798)
【Itaru】Basically, the discharge phenomenon won't occur with one second, right? Then just operate the microwave beforehand for about 30 seconds without sending a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A8)
【Itaru】Wait a while after that, and try it again with the timer set at one second. If you do that, won't the discharge phenomenon occur even with just one second?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B8)
【Kurisu】Any Basis?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017D2)
【Itaru】Zilch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A8)
【Rintaro】Uhh, Mayuri, got anything else!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C6)
【Mayuri】Eh, well...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E0)
 Then, how about changing the garnish in the onigiri I bought last night-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F4)
【Rintaro】You remember what garnish you had in the onigiri you ate last night?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001904)
【Mayuri】Okaka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019CE)
【Kurisu】A-an immediate response!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DE)
Seems she remembers it clearly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F2)
【Mayuri】So then, change the okaka to, um...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A0C)
 Let's go with mentaiko-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A20)
...Maybe I should search for another test subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A30)
In the end, the four lab mems sit silently, obviously making me think we can't complete a single experiment.
