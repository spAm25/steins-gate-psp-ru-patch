【Rintaro】Tremble, right arm of mine... The contract compels you to comply to my command. Don the dark flames of prison. Fulfill my desire. The desire of destruction. Thus returning dust to dust, ashes to ashes--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6C)
【Rintaro】Hrraahm!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADC)
I pull both arms in at full force, removing the microwave's door with an unpleasant sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AEC)
The screws were loosened, but it seems to have snapped somewhere because I did it by force.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B04)
【Mayuri】Ahh~, this means I can't warm up any more karaage-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B14)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, this is no longer a microwave. It's a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B24)
【Mayuri】That's tyranny-. Then, Okarin, go buy a new microwave-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B34)
【Rintaro】I don't have that sort of money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B44)
And I'm doing this because its one of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) improvements Daru told me to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B54)
Removing the microwave door means we don't have to deal with the annoyance of opening it when we send D-mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB4)
Daru's tampering with the microwave's programming with the X68000. So he can disable the safety mechanism that stops the microwave when the door's open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC4)
He's already programmed the forwarding from a dedicated phone feature.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C18)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C28)
Moeka takes a picture with her phone camera.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C38)
I cover up the lens with my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C48)
【Rintaro】I told you photography is prohibited.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF4)
【Moeka】...Commemoration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D98)
【Rintaro】Commemorating what? Anyway, just don't shoot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E46)
Moeka obediently complies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEA)
I had only registered her as Lab Mem Number 005 just a while ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8E)
When the choices were to let her leak the time machine or to silence her by forcing her into our group, I reluctantly choose the latter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001032)
【Rintaro】Tch... I've gone too soft... Long ago, I would've already cut Shining Finger's life...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D6)
Moeka doesn't distance herself from me, even when I start monologuing right next to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117A)
Looks like she wants to ask something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121E)
【Rintaro】What is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C2)
【Moeka】...Is it really a time machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001366)
【Rintaro】It really is. I'll show you later. So you must not disclose it. Okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140A)
Moeka nods at my warning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
【Itaru】Alright, program complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F0)
After about thirty minutes of reading her technical book, Kurisu shuts it closed when she hears Daru's voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016FA)
【Kurisu】Then lets resume the experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170A)
【Mayuri】But-, won't Manager scold us again-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AE)
【Rintaro】Heheheh, don't worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. "I swear we won't shake the building any more today".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001852)
【Rintaro】Basically! The no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday's tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001900)
【Kurisu】That doesn't settle anything. Why you're so confident with yourself is a mystery to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A4)
【Rintaro】So in other words, is this what you want to say, Christina? "Kill him"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A52)
【Kurisu】No it's not!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B00)
【Kurisu】Besides, I don't think a wimpy man like Okabe could stand a chance against Manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAE)
【Mayuri】He's so muscley, you know-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5E)
With that said, it's impossible to experiment in this rickety old building without shaking it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D02)
I have no choice but to negotiate with Manager somehow. And then the remaining four people here turn their looks towards me in anticipation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA6)
Are they planning to sacrifice me...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4A)
【Rintaro】Tch, is that Steins;Gate's choice? ...however...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EEE)
Trying to think of a way to avoid talking to Manager, I spontaneously step up to the window and look out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F92)
【Rintaro】Hmm...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002082)
The road is down outside the window. Traffic is sparse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002126)
A single woman polishes her bicycle in front of the building. Squatting next to that woman, watching her work, is a girl. Those two are alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021CA)
From the window, I can only see the backs of their heads, but I know who they are without seeing their faces.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000226E)
【Rintaro】Hey, you Working Warrior!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002312)
When I call her, Suzuha looks left and right while wiping the sweat off her brow before finally looking up here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E2)
【Suzuha】Sup.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257E)
Suzuha and the girl beside her lift up their faces like fish caught on lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002622)
The silent girl is Braun Tube Workshop owner, Mister Braun's only daughter, Tennouji Nae. Looks like she came to play with her father today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C6)
I've always doubted just how it's even statistically possible for such a muscular man to give birth to...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000276A)
When Nae makes eye contact with me, she bows her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000280E)
I return a nod, and call out to Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D8)
【Rintaro】What are you doing there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000297C)
【Suzuha】Can't you tell by looking? I'm polishing my bicycle~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A20)
【Rintaro】Aren't you working today?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC4)
【Suzuha】I am~. I mean, that's why I'm here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B68)
You're polishing your bicycle even though you're at work?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C0C)
Does the Braun Tube Workshop have that much free time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CB0)
To put it bluntly, was there even a need for a part timer?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D54)
【Kurisu】Is she still tinkering with her bicycle?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF8)
I can hear Kurisu's sour voice from inside the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E9C)
【Kurisu】She was there when I a while ago, glaring her eyes out at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F40)
Seems she has a grudge against Kurisu like always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FE4)
【Rintaro】Hey, Working Warrior! What about Mister Braun?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003088)
【Suzuha】Mister Braun? Who's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000312C)
【Rintaro】The first floor junk shop manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031D0)
【Kurisu】It's not a junk shop, it's a Braun tube specialty shop, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003274)
Assistant's so picky. Junk shop was just a joke to add a little Hououin Kyouma spice to the mix.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003318)
【Suzuha】Ah-, is that who you meant by Mister Braun? Ahhaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033BC)
【Nae】Daddy's name isn't Mister Braun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003460)
The daughter diligently corrects us on her father's name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003504)
Doesn't look like she gets the joke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035A8)
【Suzuha】Manager's on a service trip~. I don't think he'll be back for a while~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000364C)
【Rintaro】Wh-what!? Is that true!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F0)
【Suzuha】It's true~. 'Cause otherwise, I wouldn't be out here skipping~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003794)
【Suzuha】Ah, Nae, keep that a secret from Manager, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384A)
【Nae】Then, let me ride your bicycle next time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003862)
This is such a blessing!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003872)
I give my gratitude to Working Warrior, shifting my attention back inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038CE)
【Rintaro】You heard her. This for sure is Steins;Gate's choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038DE)
【Rintaro】Currently, Mister Braun is absent. In other words, we can experiment to our heart's content!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038EE)
【Kurisu】So in the end, you're postponing finding a fundamental solution again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038FE)
【Rintaro】I'm saying it's Steins;Gate's choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003946)
【Itaru】That doesn't matter. For now, I just want to try out the Microwave Ophone 2nd Edition ver1.03.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000398E)
【Mayuri】Second ed-ed-shin verz erosion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039A8)
【Itaru】2nd Edition ver1.03.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039B8)
I don't really understand that model number, but...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039C8)
【Rintaro】Quit it with that unsophisticated naming. This improved version shall be called "Heavenly Merry-Go-Round".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E2)
【Kurisu】The name doesn't matter. Let's just start the experi--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A10)
A sudden shutter sound interrupts our quarrel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AA4)
Moeka has her phone camera turned this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AB4)
How many times have I told her not to take pictures...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ACE)
【Moeka】...Because, you looked happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BC2)
Mayuri smiles happily at those words. Daru shows no apparent change. Kurisu rudely turns away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BD2)
【Kurisu】No way. At the very least, I'm just fed up with this club.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF4)
【Itaru】Nevertheless, this assistant is a <DICT>tsundere</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C0E)
【Kurisu】Who are you calling a tsundere!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C28)
【Itaru】Ohh~, Makise-shi, you know what tsundere means?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C42)
【Kurisu】...I-I don't know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C52)
【Rintaro】It certainly looks like you do. It's written all over your face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C6C)
【Kurisu】Mmmgh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C86)
Kurisu bites her lip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C96)
Looks like she is accustomed to otaku culture after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CA6)
I wonder how she got that knowledge even when she's been living in America.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D3A)
【Moeka】...Quick, the experiment
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D4E)
Moeka's tired of waiting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D5E)
Ever since we told her the entire truth, this Shining Finger has been showing great interest in the time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D6E)
Of course, she won't write an article. She signed a non-disclosure agreement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D7E)
If she violates it, I'll confiscate her phone by force and use it as a threat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E06)
The Microwave Ophone (Temp) can send a D-mail at any time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E4E)
【Itaru】Well, I'm setting it up so it forwards to Okarin's phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E6A)
Daru types my phone's mail address into the X68000's keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EB2)
We decided Mayuri was going to send the D-mails, so she started typing out mails on her phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ECE)
We set the microwave timer to 60# and press the warm button. And even though the door is removed, the microwave still begins to operate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D2)
The discharge phenomenon occurs, and Mayuri's mail goes through the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s dedicated phone to my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044D6)
【Moeka】This is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044E6)
Moeka peeks at my phone screen, her breath taken away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044F6)
She's always expressionless so I don't know what she's thinking, but she actually seems surprised to see the D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000450C)
【Rintaro】What do you think? Now you should understand that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is an honest to goodness time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000451C)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000452C)
Without answering, Moeka just opens her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000453C)
【Suzuha】Hey~!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045B2)
Working Warrior calls from outside the window.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045C2)
【Suzuha】It's shaking again~! And there's even some strange light~! Just what are you doing!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045D2)
I decide to ignore the outfield jeer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045E2)
It would be a different story if it were Manager, but I'm not afraid of Working Warrior's objections at all.
