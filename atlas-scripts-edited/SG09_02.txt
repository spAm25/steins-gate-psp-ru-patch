D-mails I should cancel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EC)
In other words, D-mails that have activated Reading Steiner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007FC)
There are two of them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000856)
The first was the one with the winning LOTO SIX numbers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000866)
I sent that from my phone to my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000886)
It's not too hard to cancel that one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000896)
The problem is the other one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A6)
The name of that D-mail's sender.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B6)
The name I'd rather not say again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090C)
Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091C)
I understand the contents of the D-mail she sent before as part of our experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092C)
Back then, I didn't fully understand D-mails. That's why we kept experimenting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093C)
When Moeka said I want to send a D-mail, I gave her these requests.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000094C)
Make the contents simple enough that any changes to the past are obvious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000095C)
And make the contents public to all lab members.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000096C)
In the end, what Moeka sent was to undo her phone model exchange that happened a few days before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000988)
The D-mail was sent to July 31.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000998)
I remember it since it's a nice cutoff date.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009A8)
I don't know how that's related to the IBN 5100's disappearance from Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009B8)
It probably influenced it through the Butterfly Effect, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C8)
I don't have the same hesitation as I did back with Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2A)
I don't have to hold back against Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3A)
That friend of ours killed Mayuri over and over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
I don't intend to forgive her at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6A)
So I'll cancel the D-mail Moeka sent without holding back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7A)
But the problem is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8A)
The cancellation D-mail needs to be sent from Moeka's phone itself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9A)
If I sent a mail from my address saying Don't change models, I don't think it would sway Moeka's intention at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAA)
But I don't know where she is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABA)
I click my tongue impatiently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACA)
Unless I can locate and obtain her cellphone, I can't cancel her D-mail...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C62)
When I returned to the lab, I set things up so I could time leap at any time, but I still ended up in anxiety.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7C)
【Mayuri】Haah. I'm stuffed-. Mayushii barely ate today, so I've been oh so hungry-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8C)
【Kurisu】Is it still going on tomorrow?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9C)
【Mayuri】Yeah, and not just tomorrow, but the day after too-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAC)
Mayuri, who just got back to the lab from ComiMa 30 minutes ago, and Kurisu, who was watching over the lab, finish eating their cup noodle dinner. Now Mayuri's lecturing about ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBC)
It was already past 8.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
Nothing happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDC)
As expected, Mayuri didn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEC)
Most likely, her death limit was extended until about this time tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFC)
That's all up to somebody's will-- perhaps even God's or Fate's.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
Or maybe it's merely a coincidence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
But that doesn't matter now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D36)
【Mayuri】Okidokey then-, Mayushii's got an early day tomorrow, so I'm going home, kay-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D46)
Mayuri makes a big stretch and starts getting ready to go home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE6)
She also woke up at 5 today, stopping by the lab before heading to Ariake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF6)
Looks like she plans to get up that early tomorrow too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E06)
By the way, Daru's also enlisted in the same war, so I haven't seen him today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E16)
He told me earlier he's heading straight home without visiting the lab. Busy checking his spoils of war, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E8C)
【Mayuri】Heyhey, Chris-chan, Okarin, won't either of you come to ComiMa-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9C)
【Rintaro】I'll pass, but Assistant looks like she wants to go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB6)
【Kurisu】Haah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC6)
Kurisu jumps up at my prompt answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE0)
【Kurisu】Hey, Okabe, what are you lying about on your own?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF0)
【Rintaro】Just now, weren't you listening intently to Mayuri's cosplay talk?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F00)
【Kurisu】Well yeah, but nobody said anything about going.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F1A)
【Mayuri】Let's go~, Chris-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F2A)
Kurisu's a closeted @channeler, but I guess she doesn't have a deep understanding of the otaku side of things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3A)
It's not always true that @channeler = otaku, but it's rare for the former to not be the latter. When I think about it, she's hinted that she has interest in cosplay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F54)
【Kurisu】I refuse. I can't breathe in such huge crowds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6E)
【Mayuri】Compared to today, there's not many people on the second day-. If you come in the afternoon, it'll be okay. All the popular doujinshi and stuff will be sold out, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F88)
【Kurisu】Okabe, you go. You're Mayuri's guardian, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
【Mayuri】That's not it-. Mayushii is Okarin's hostage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB2)
【Kurisu】Ahh, yeah, yeah. That's what it was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC2)
【Kurisu】It'll be bad if your hostage escapes, right? Shouldn't you take her along with handcuffs?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD2)
【Rintaro】There's something I must do here in Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
【Kurisu】What do you mean, something you must do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFC)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100C)
The search for Kiryuu Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101C)
I already sent a mail. I'm awaiting a reply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102C)
I wrote I want to see you, but hope looks thin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001046)
【Kurisu】Judging by your silence, you just don't want to go, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001056)
【Rintaro】Christina. We need to talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001066)
【Kurisu】Again? Abrupt as usual, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001076)
【Rintaro】Hm? What do you mean "again"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001086)
【Kurisu】Nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A0)
【Mayuri】Huh, huh? What do you mean "talk"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B0)
【Mayuri】You know, Okarin, and Chris-chan, you've really gotten along well lately, haven't you? You're always talking together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010CA)
【Mayuri】Mayushii really wants to join in on your secret meetings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DA)
【Rintaro】It's just a meeting about the Time Leap Machine. Even if you do join in, it'll probably just sound like gibberish to you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010EA)
That's not quite it, but it wasn't a lie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010FA)
【Rintaro】And what Christina and I are going to talk about now, could possibly decide whether or not she goes to ComiMa. Mayuri, please wait warmly! Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001114)
【Mayuri】Ah, okay, I get it-♪ Thank you, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130A)
Mayuri waits in the room while I take Kurisu outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131A)
【Rintaro】And so, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132A)
【Kurisu】I don't intend to go to ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133A)
【Rintaro】Just now, you said "again", didn't you. So, you mean we've done this one-on-one consultation several times before, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000135C)
【Kurisu】So now your memories are all confused, huh. Does our little insane mad scientist have a <DICT>acetylcholine</DICT> deficiency?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000136C)
【Rintaro】Answer me seriously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001386)
【Kurisu】Something's off about you, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001396)
【Rintaro】Please. Answer me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A6)
【Kurisu】I don't have to; it's like you just said. We've already gone outside like this four or five times to talk about what to do with the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B6)
【Rintaro】What about me actually time leaping?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D0)
For one instant, Kurisu opens her eyes wide in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EA)
But soon after, she starts glaring angrily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FA)
【Kurisu】Did you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140A)
I nod.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141A)
【Rintaro】More than ten times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142A)
【Kurisu】Eh, that many!? What are you doing so selfishly!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001544)
Hmm... It looks like she doesn't know anything about our discussion about Lukako, or how many times I've time leaped and changed world lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001554)
Obviously...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FA)
I've moved world lines three times so far. For now, let's call the first world line where Mayuri dies α World Line 1.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A0)
When I ran away with Faris from the Viral Attackers, that's α World Line 2.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001746)
When Lukako was a girl, that's α World Line 3.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AA)
And now I'm at α World Line 4.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BA)
By the time I canceled Lukako's D-mail, α World Lines 1-3 were "undone" from my subjectivity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CA)
At the same time, for Kurisu and everyone else in α World Line 4, α World Line 3 where Lukako was a girl is another unrecognizable possible world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017DA)
I guess I have to explain everything again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001862)
I start the tedious talk with Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001894)
【Kurisu】...I think I got the gist of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A4)
Kurisu sighs, and lightly taps my upper arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BE)
【Kurisu】Don't overdo it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CE)
【Rintaro】It's a disgrace to be encouraged by my assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E8)
【Kurisu】Why's it a disgrace!? I even tried so hard to be nice. You're really full of yourself, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F8)
【Rintaro】I don't need sympathy. Everything went wrong because of me. I'm getting my just deserts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001908)
【Rintaro】So, Assistant, you've talked to me like this four or five times, but I've done this each time to the point it's torture.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001922)
【Kurisu】Okabe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001932)
【Rintaro】Don't worry about me; worry about Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001942)
【Rintaro】Most likely, Mayuri will die tomorrow. I don't know how, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001952)
If Mayuri doesn't come to the lab after going to ComiMa, she probably won't get killed by Moeka. But the way things are going, the world won't let us avoid Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001962)
Unless we escape the α World Line, it will definitely converge to her death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001972)
【Rintaro】...I'm sorry about this, but I want you to ascertain Mayuri's death tomorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001982)
【Kurisu】So go to ComiMa, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001992)
【Rintaro】We can't avoid her death. Resistance is futile. You just have to ascertain Mayuri's death and report it to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019A2)
【Rintaro】Once you contact me, I'll time leap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019BC)
【Kurisu】...I can't believe you know Mayuri will die, but won't do anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019CC)
【Kurisu】It just doesn't feel real, but it's the truth, isn't it? I can tell from your eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019E6)
【Kurisu】...is everything okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F6)
【Rintaro】It's not okay. Saving Mayuri still hasn't--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A10)
【Kurisu】That's true about Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A20)
Kurisu interrupts me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A30)
【Kurisu】But I'm asking about you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A40)
【Rintaro】What about me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5A)
【Kurisu】Don't get so worked up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A6A)
It's rare for her to give me such a worried face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7A)
【Rintaro】I told you, didn't I? Don't worry about me, but about Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A8A)
【Rintaro】Tomorrow, I'm going to look for Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A9A)
If Mayuri doesn't die tomorrow, I can postpone time leaping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AAA)
If Mayuri does die, then I should go back to the past no matter what.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ABA)
【Rintaro】I don't want to give Mayuri any painful thoughts if I can help it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD4)
【Kurisu】Then you should time leap right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE4)
【Rintaro】...When's the deadline in this world line? Unless I find that out, I can't form a good plan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF8)
【Kurisu】「...I'm just saying this,
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
 but I don't want to see Mayuri die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B26)
【Rintaro】I know how that feels, but you're the only one I can ask.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B40)
【Kurisu】You really trust me, don't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B50)
【Rintaro】...You are my assistant after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6A)
Kurisu forces a laugh at my joke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7A)
【Kurisu】You're full of yourself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B8A)
Our strategy is set.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B9A)
Kurisu will go to her first ever ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BAA)
When I tell her that, Mayuri will be innocently delighted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D0A)
I haven't met with Mayuri today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1A)
I'd be with her the entire time if I could, but I still didn't go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D2A)
Kiryuu Moeka hasn't replied.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3A)
I have no choice but to seek her myself now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4A)
I don't know much about that woman in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5A)
The only clue I have is the name of her publishing company, Arc Rewrite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D6A)
I remember Moeka saying she worked there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D7A)
I quickly find it after searching online.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D8A)
Sure enough, their main business was producing PC magazine articles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9A)
Moreover, their office is in Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DAA)
I promptly try asking them by phone, but got an answering machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DBA)
I guess they're still closed for Obon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DCA)
Or maybe nobody's at the office?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DDA)
Oh, whatever...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DEA)
Looks like I have to go there directly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F00)
Early morning on the second day of ComiMa, Akiba is empty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F10)
Right about now, most of the otaku are forming a huge line in Ariake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F20)
I've experienced the craze of that festival many times myself. It's literal war.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F30)
Whenever Mayuri tells me she's going to participate, I go in shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F40)
I always imagine Mayuri getting trampled to death by the otaku avalanche.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F50)
But Mayuri is actually surprisingly quick on her strong legs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F60)
She possesses the astounding ability to smoothly weave through the crowd of people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F70)
So it's more likely that Kurisu will get trampled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F80)
I couldn't help but sympathize with my assistant. I might've done a bad thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002020)
I find the publishing company, Arc Rewrite on the outskirts of Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002030)
It's in a glass-sided multi-tenant building. Pretty fancy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002040)
I quickly charge the office, but nobody is there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002050)
After waiting about 30 minutes, a man who looks like a staff-member comes, so I ask him for Kiryuu Moeka's contact address. Of course, I lie that I'm her relative.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002060)
But the answer he gives me is unexpected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002070)
【Staff Member】We don't have a part timer by that name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002080)
【Rintaro】You don't...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002090)
Balls...! I've been tricked!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A0)
In the first place, Moeka's part of SERN's mercenary force, the Rounders. She's been working here in Akiba while hiding her history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B0)
It's not like she'd give out her real place of work.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C0)
Do I have no more clues...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D0)
Just when I've given up, the Arc Rewrite staffer pounds his hand as if he remembered something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E0)
【Staff Member】No, wait. I'm certain she came here for just two days, but there was a female part timer who we lost contact of. I think her name might have been Kiryuu...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F0)
【Staff Member】Maybe we still have her resume.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002100)
I frantically bow my head and ask him to look for it, and he acknowledges, though a little hesitant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000221C)
I try going to the address written on the resume. It's a beat up apartment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000222C)
It doesn't seem like the place a young lady would live alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002332)
When I approach the apartment, I feel a strange unease.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002342)
I don't know why, but there's a police officer there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002448)
One patrol car is parked in front.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000254E)
And in front of one room on the second floor-- Room 202, which is Moeka's, according to her resume-- there's a blue sheet covering the door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000255E)
What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000256E)
What happened?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000260E)
I call out to a uniformed officer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000261E)
【Rintaro】Excuse me, did the person in that room move?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000262E)
【Policeman】Huh? No.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000263E)
【Rintaro】Then...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000264E)
【Policeman】Are you a concerned party?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000265E)
【Rintaro】...an acquaintance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000266E)
【Policeman】You didn't hear anything?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000267E)
The police officer seems to have a tough time talking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000268E)
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000269E)
【Rintaro】What happened?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026AE)
【Policeman】Suicide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002730)
【Rintaro】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002740)
It took me everything I had to ask again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002750)
Why now...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002760)
Why... suicide...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002770)
【Rintaro】When was that!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002780)
【Policeman】Yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002790)
【Rintaro】...no way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027A0)
【Policeman】...the body should've been carried to the third Chiyoda hospital. Doesn't look like she has any relatives. We're stumped. Will you go see her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027B0)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027C0)
I lower my head and leave the area.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002860)
Dead...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002870)
Moeka is dead?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002880)
What's up with that? I don't understand at all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002890)
Just what's going on...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028A0)
It was suicide?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B0)
The woman who mercilessly killed Mayuri, committed suicide...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C0)
Or is this a conspiracy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D0)
Internal discord turned into murder, covered up as suicide...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E0)
Today is the 16th. Yesterday was the 15th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029CC)
The first time Moeka attacked the lab was the 13th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029DC)
Three days have passed since then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029EC)
As a result of slowly moving back to the original world line, Mayuri's death somehow gets pushed back day by day. That meant Moeka's attack was getting pushed back day by day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029FC)
So this means that in this world line, Moeka no longer attacks the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A6C)
But even so, why did she die...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A7C)
I don't get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A8C)
I don't get it, but this is the first time this has happened...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A9C)
How should I deal with this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AAC)
What is it I must do...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ABC)
I squat on the spot, grabbing my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B16)
If Moeka is dead, then maybe Mayuri won't be killed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B26)
...I don't think such a convenient future will come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B36)
At least, the world wishes for Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B46)
It'll do whatever it can to stop me from preventing that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B56)
I'm the one changing the world line as he pleases, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B66)
Just give me a break already...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC0)
Why are all these extraordinary things happening?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BD0)
I mean, until just a few weeks ago, I was just a pretentious hipster college student.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BEC)
I hadn't seen people close to me die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BFC)
Both of my parents, and my grandparents, are alive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C0C)
I lived my entire life without having to deal with death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C1C)
Yet, in these past mere three weeks-- virtually, more than that-- just how many times have I faced death?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C2C)
My heart's been strained to the limit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C3C)
It's been hard to tough it out until this point too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C4C)
Just one more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C5C)
Most likely, there's just one more D-mail I must cancel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C6C)
If I could only steal Moeka's phone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C7C)
【Rintaro】A time leap...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C98)
Let's time leap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA8)
Moeka died at noontime yesterday, the 15th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CB8)
Then I should go back to before then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CC8)
Moeka's reason for suicide doesn't matter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD8)
I don't know why that woman would kill Mayuri or herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE8)
The only thing I do know is that I need to contact that woman to cancel the D-mail...!
