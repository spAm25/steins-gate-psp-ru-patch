#WRITE(PTR, $0000043E)
Before me are Lab Mems Mayuri, Kurisu, and Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004E2)
Faris and Moeka seem busy, so I didn't contact them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000586)
Daru mailed me some bullshit like I've got things to do today, so I'll pass.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000062A)
I was prepared for Lukako to refuse my invitation, but I guess her coming here means she's forgiven me for that perverted sexual harassment for the time being.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006CE)
【Rintaro】I want you guys to go shopping for the party.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000772)
I already explained to the lab mems what Suzuha told me yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000820)
【Kurisu】What are you doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C4)
【Rintaro】Me? I'm going to pursue that Working Warrior, and report on the situation in detail--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000097A)
【Kurisu】Stop that, it's in bad taste. Just let her be alone with her father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A1E)
【Rintaro】Heheheh, don't lash out at every little thing, Christina. You don't understand the thing we call human mentality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC2)
【Rintaro】People make rejections like that because they want to guide their will for themselves at all costs!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B70)
【Kurisu】You're too self-righteous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C14)
【Rintaro】In the first place, Christina. You and Working Warrior are fighting. For you to be so considerate of her despite that fact makes you a hypocrite!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB8)
【Kurisu】Your actions are too inhuman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D66)
【Mayuri】That's right-. I don't think it's good to intrude-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0A)
Even during the strategy meeting, Mayuri keeps making her costume.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EAE)
Lukako hasn't decided to come yet, but she's zealous nonetheless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5C)
【Mayuri】More importantly, no matter what the outcome is, we need to go waaarmly welcome her-. If it's for that reason, then Mayushii will happily go shopping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001000)
【Luka】But, um, actually, I haven't met with this Suzuha-san person...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AE)
【Mayuri】Suzu-san's a really good person, Luka-chan will get along with her too-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001160)
【Kurisu】A good person, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000120E)
【Rintaro】Anyway, I'm going to pursue her now--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012BC)
【Kurisu】Like I said, you can't do that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001360)
【Rintaro】Tch, know your place as an assistant and stop ordering me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001524)
In the end, she wouldn't allow the pursuit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160C)
【Kurisu】It's because I wouldn't agree if you escaped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B0)
In order to get Kurisu to join the party, I end up helping with the shopping. I can't escape either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E2)
Fuckdamn shitcunt...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001886)
Damn Kurisu, lately it feels like she's becoming more and more of a class chairman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192A)
At this rate, she might commandeer the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A22)
I'm shocked. Could this be what Suzuha was warning me about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC6)
...Yeah, right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B8C)
【Kurisu】But, well...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C30)
Kurisu walks, hanging her head slightly as she scratches her cheek.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CDE)
【Kurisu】It would be great if we could find Amane-san's father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D82)
【Rintaro】Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E26)
【Kurisu】I think I'd be envious of that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ECA)
Now that she mentions it, she's got an issue with her father too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6E)
Maybe she sympathizes with Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002052)
【Kurisu】Hey, Okabe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F6)
And then, Kurisu suddenly starts squirming shyly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A4)
【Kurisu】About what happened before, I apologize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002248)
【Rintaro】Before?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022EC)
【Kurisu】I wrongly assumed that you sexually harassed Urushibara-san, and pummeled you with a book.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000239A)
【Kurisu】I didn't think about it until after the fact, but it didn't look like you were joking back then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243E)
【Kurisu】And yet, I acted on impulse, without even considering what you had to say...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E2)
【Rintaro】Don't sweat it. No matter my intentions, the fact of the matter is that I made Lukako cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002590)
【Kurisu】Just making sure, but you aren't a perverted sexual harassing jerk, are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002634)
【Rintaro】Making sure, my ass! Are you seriously trying to apologize!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
【Kurisu】Because I don't want to you to use experiments as an excuse for acts of perversion. I'm involved too, for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002786)
【Rintaro】Don't look down on me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000282A)
【Rintaro】To me, friends are fortune.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028CE)
【Rintaro】I am an insane mad scientist with a 170 IQ brain, but I'm well aware that even I have limits to what I can do alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002972)
【Rintaro】The Microwave Ophone (Temp) wouldn't have gotten this far if I didn't have you and Daru at my side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A20)
【Kurisu】Okabe...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC4)
【Rintaro】I am Lab Mem Number 001, the founder of the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B68)
【Rintaro】If my comrades are in danger, then I'll rush to their aid. I would not consider in the slightest any action that would bring harm to a comrade either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C16)
【Kurisu】Pff...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CBA)
【Rintaro】What's so funny?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D68)
【Kurisu】That's pretentious hipster bullshit at full throttle. It's pathetic just listening to it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E0C)
【Rintaro】Hmph...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EBA)
【Kurisu】But, I don't think that's so bad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F5E)
【Kurisu】The research institutes I've been to in America gather talented people the world over, at the forefront of research. It's quite brutal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003002)
【Kurisu】Everyone's pride is through the roof, since everyone thinks they're the best. It's a common occurrence to see people getting in each other's way or insulting each other face to face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030B0)
【Kurisu】When I got my thesis published in "Science" as the researcher representative, all the older men would mumble and complain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000315E)
【Kurisu】And when I came back here for a "reverse abroad study" in high school, all my classmates were too afraid to talk to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000320C)
【Kurisu】So, compared to that, your lab is childish... but very comfortable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032B0)
...Seems like everyone has their own problems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003354)
【Kurisu】And now, Okabe's seriously concerned about Amane-san. I appreciate that part of you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003402)
【Kurisu】Ah, b-but, it's not like I'm praising you, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034A6)
For some reason, she's flushed and flustered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000354A)
【Kurisu】But, somehow, that's what I thought, or...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035EE)
【Rintaro】...In the end, maybe I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000369C)
【Kurisu】Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003740)
【Rintaro】Maybe I just wanted friends.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037E4)
【Kurisu】Okabe....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003888)
【Rintaro】In any case, there aren't many people I can call friends...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000392C)
I am an insane mad scientist traveling the world. An enemy to all around me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039D0)
This too is an evil deed devised by my devious brain. Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A7E)
【Kurisu】I... umm, think of you as an important comrade...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B22)
【Rintaro】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BC6)
【Kurisu】You said so before, didn't you? That I'm an important comrade.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C6A)
【Kurisu】That made me really... happy, or, well...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D0E)
【Rintaro】Do you have a fever?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DBC)
【Kurisu】No.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E6A)
【Kurisu】What the hell, I was even getting a better opinion of you! I don't care anymore, stupid!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F18)
【Kurisu】Really, stupid...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FC8)
Kurisu squares her shoulders as she quickly walks ahead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000406C)
I hurriedly chase after her, confused in my heart of hearts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004110)
That girl... is she scheming something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041B4)
Maybe she really is plotting to commandeer the lab....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004258)
No, wait, maybe she's trying to trick me since she doesn't like how we're having a party for Suzuha, her sworn enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042FC)
Tch, I won't fall for your assistant-like wiles, dummy!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043B0)
Now, let's think of something else.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004454)
Let's think about today's Last Supper, Operation Eldhrimnir.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044F8)
The Last Supper refers to our party for Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000459C)
In the case she reunites with her father, we'll just celebrate normally. In other words, her Last Supper in Tokyo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046E0)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004784)
If she doesn't reunite with her father, we'll restrain her and make her a test subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004828)
To gather D-mail experimental data, we have to make some sacrifices.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048CC)
Since we'd change the past somehow with a D-mail, it would become the Last Supper before the change
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004970)
The lab budget-- mostly my pocket money-- is tight, but it's okay to party every once in a while.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A14)
I'm not hoping for any convenient low-risk, high-return thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AB8)
High-risk, high-return. That is my pride as a mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B5C)
Heheheh, I can already picture Suzuha's crying face as she falls into despair!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C88)
【Kurisu】Huh? Over there, isn't that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D6A)
Where Kurisu's pointing-- Yodobashi's entrance-- I can see Daru come out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E20)
【Rintaro】Found you, Daru!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E4E)
【Itaru】Eh? Ah--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E6A)
I stop him from running away by grasping the nape of his neck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F40)
【Rintaro】Why didn't you respond to my summons?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F50)
【Itaru】Like I said, I've got something to do...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F60)
【Rintaro】Which is?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F7A)
【Itaru】Offline meet...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F8A)
【Rintaro】Inexcusable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004FA4)
【Itaru】Wait, just listen a sec--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004FB4)
【Rintaro】Offline meet, or an all-you-can-eat lab mem girls' home cooking party. Which do you choose?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004FCE)
【Itaru】Home... cooking...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004FE8)
【Itaru】O-one question. Is Faris-tan there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005040)
Before Kurisu can answer that, I whisper to Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005050)
【Rintaro】Naturally. Since Faris is a lab mem too. Heheheh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005076)
【Itaru】Dammit-! Why must you give me a time conflict! At least hold it off till tomorrow...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005086)
【Rintaro】What'll it be? Time to decide. It's your choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050A0)
【Itaru】I want to eat Faris-tan's home cooking...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050B0)
【Rintaro】If you give up the offline meet, then that settles it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050CA)
【Itaru】I give it up. I give up the offline meeeet!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050DA)
Daru surrenders all too quickly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005214)
When we return to the lab, Mayuri and Lukako are already starting preparations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000525C)
【Mayuri】Huhuh, Daru-kun's here too-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052A4)
【Itaru】What about Faris-tan? Where is she?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052EC)
【Kurisu】Hashida. You've been tricked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005306)
【Mayuri】Faris-chan said she couldn't come-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005356)
【Itaru】Wait, seriously!? Hey, Okarin! What is the meaning of this! This isn't just a prank!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005366)
【Rintaro】I'll tell you at the next possible opportunity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005380)
【Itaru】You're fucking kidding me-. It was a long-awaited time machine offline meet...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053C8)
【Kurisu】A time machine offline meet? 'the hell's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053D8)
【Itaru】There's a scifi BBS I frequent. An offline meet for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053F2)
【Itaru】They even planned to have pro author visits. I won't forgive you, Okarin. Ever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000540C)
【Rintaro】Gh, why didn't you just say that first? I would've gone to an offline meet like that too...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000541C)
Then I suddenly sense a strange smell.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000542C)
【Rintaro】...Does anyone else smell that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005446)
【Kurisu】Smell?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005456)
【Rintaro】Did someone overload an outlet and short something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000054B0)
【Luka】S-sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000054C0)
Lukako's apologizing for something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000054D0)
【Luka】I think that's probably the smell of what Mayuri... cooked...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000054E0)
What did... she say...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000054F0)
This is the smell of cooking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000550A)
【Kurisu】I'll help too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005528)
【Luka】Okay, then warm these eggs--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005538)
【Kurisu】Hm. Can I use the Microwave Ophone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000559C)
【Luka】N-no, you can't! If you put raw eggs in a microwave, they'll explode...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055AC)
【Kurisu】We took the door off, so there shouldn't be a problem, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055C8)
【Mayuri】Chop, chop, ch-ch-chop, chop, chop, chop, chop...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055D8)
【Luka】M-Mayuri-chan, it's dangerous to hold it like that...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055E8)
Seems kind of freeform.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000567C)
Daru and I exchange glances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000568C)
【Rintaro】Maybe we should help too. Or actually, maybe we should get those girls out of the kitchen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000569C)
【Itaru】Isn't it the same both ways?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056AC)
【Rintaro】I'm getting vertigo. I want this reality to change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056CE)
【Itaru】<DICT>This</DICT> Okarin, I'll never forget this grudge for all eternity...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056DE)
【Rintaro】Honestly, I'm sorry, seriously... But Daru. Please die by my side...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056F8)
【Itaru】I'll order pizza as a backup.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005760)
Not good... not good at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005770)
The ashen air in my chest doubles, triples, quadruples.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005780)
The girls' Trinity attack transformed the lab into a phase 5 pandemic in the span of an hour...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005806)
I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005816)
【Rintaro】...It's me. It seems like the evil god's seal has been released. If I don't respond in an hour, tell my parents... I love them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005838)
【Itaru】Okarin, that's a <DICT>death flag</DICT>...
