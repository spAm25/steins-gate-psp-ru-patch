As I open the door to "MayQueen+Nyan⑯", I am greeted by two smiling cat-eared maids.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000828)
【Mayuri】Ah, it's Okarin!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000920)
One of them is Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000930)
She works here as "Mayushii NyanNyan".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000940)
Due to that, I also come here about 2 times a month.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000950)
I guess you could call me a regular customer, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA4)
By the way, I never went to any other maid cafes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B48)
【Mayuri】Okarin, welcome home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BEC)
Bowing her head again, Mayuri exclaims as if she just thought of something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C90)
【Mayuri】Heyhey, Okarin, Mayushii just realized something...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D34)
【Mayuri】I can combine "Okarin" and "welcome home" and just say "Welcome Homekarin"♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD8)
How trivial...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3C)
【Faris】Kyouma, good job coming here nyan. Take it easy!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107E)
The other maid, - Faris NyanNyan - calls me by my true name as if it's natural, and attacks me with a <DICT>combo</DICT> of the upward glance treatment and cat-like gestures.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001122)
She's the number 1 maid of "MayQueen+Nyan⑯".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C6)
She looks more like a loli than Mayuri, but they're about the same age.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001300)
【Faris】Daru-nyan is here, too. He's hopelessly wayting for something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A4)
The reason Daru frequents this shop is to see Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001448)
Daru is the type of maniac who occasionally visits Faris' personal blog while mumbling something along the lines of "Faris, you're so cute, Faris".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014EC)
I keep telling him to choose between 2D and 3D, but he keeps ignoring me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001590)
As for myself, I am not very good at dealing with her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001634)
That's because "I feel as if I cannot win against her".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001718)
【Faris】Are you holding anyother secret meeting to overthrow the Organyazation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BC)
【Rintaro】Y, yes, that is correct.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186A)
【Faris】Faris wants to join too, nya~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190E)
【Rintaro】Don't. The Organization are not weak enough for cat-eared maids to be a threat to them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019BC)
【Faris】That's nyot true! Faris has "Thyat Secret Technique", and I know it will be useful nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A60)
【Rintaro】What!? You finally mastered it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B0E)
【Faris】Thyat's right... On a journey for knowledge to Guiana highlands after overcoming the death of myaster, Faris has finally... Obtained it nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB2)
Who the hell is "myaster"...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C56)
Some time ago, I told Faris my true name and talked to her about the Organization and so on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CFA)
Since then, she got into this more than me, and she reports the situation from her side every time we meet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9E)
By the way, this is the first I've ever heard of "That Secret Technique".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4C)
【Faris】So, Kyouma, I want you to let Faris pawrticipate in the "Spirit Court" nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF0)
Uh... Looks like Faris is on a rampage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F94)
If we keep this up, I will waste at least 30 minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002038)
【Rintaro】You want to go to the "Consecrated Grounds Sanctuary"!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DC)
【Rintaro】You can't. No matter how much Secret Techniques you possess, it's too soon for you to go there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000218A)
【Faris】But! But you prawmised! Are you going to betray thyat nyan!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000222E)
【Faris】Also, Faris' big brother is there...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022D2)
No, he isn't. And what the hell is the "Spirit Court", anyway!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002376)
Faris looks at me with teary eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000241A)
Even if I know that she's messing around, this still caught me off guard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024BE)
When I talk with her, I run out of retorts to use and my mind goes out of order.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002562)
Since she is the one who always leads the conversation, I always end up having to listen to her delusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002606)
There's a limit to how far you can take a joke.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026AA)
The things I speak and the things that Faris says have a single fundamental difference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274E)
That is the fact that all I speak is the "truth", while what Faris speaks are nothing but "delusions" and "made up" stuff.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027F2)
I always have to play along with those wild ideas of hers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002896)
That's why "I feel as if I cannot win against her".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002972)
【Mayuri】Uhmm... I don't really get it, but could Mayushii also go to the "Sanctuary"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A16)
Wahh, the airhead girl joined in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ABA)
Now that it's come to this, the situation is too chaotic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B5E)
I must end this conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C0E)
【Rintaro】You mustn't. This conversation is over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CB2)
【Mayuri】Eeeh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D56)
【Faris】It's nyot fair if it's only Kyouma!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E60)
【Mayuri】That's right, it's not very nice if you don't allow Mayushii and Faris-chan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F04)
【Rintaro】...Who the hell is "Faris-chan"?」
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FBA)
【Mayuri】Faris-chan is Faris-chan.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FD4)
Riight?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003086)
【Faris】Riight?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000312A)
Mayuri and Faris smile while looking at each other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031CE)
Does she mean Faris? Could it be that Faris is her real name, and I've been mistaken all this time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003272)
That's a disturbing thought--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003320)
【Mayuri】You know, the name is kinda hard to pronounce for Mayushii, so I turned it into "Faris"♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033C4)
【Rintaro】Only that, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003472)
【Faris】Just like the girls from an all-girls school. I kinda like it nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003516)
That aside...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035BA)
【Rintaro】Just hurry up and show me to the table. How long are you planning on holding me here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003668)
【Faris】Nyahaha, apawlogies. One guidance coming up, myaster♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000370C)
【Faris】Mayushii, I'll leave it to you nyan nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037BA)
【Mayuri】Leave it to me nyan nyan♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000385E)
It's a rule for the cat-eared maids of "MayQueen+Nyan⑯" to use "nyan" to a certain degree.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003942)
Mayuri grabs my hand and leads me to the table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E6)
Mayushii NyanNyan is the only one who leads customers like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8A)
Perhaps her lack of consideration and the ability to do such things nonchalantly is the reason why she is the second most popular maid in this cafe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B3A)
I take a seat at the table Daru's at.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BDE)
About 6 people have been waiting at the entrance of the cafe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C82)
"MayQueen+Nyan⑯" holds the position of the main maid cafe in Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D26)
Though, when you consider what Faris and the others are wearing, this is more like a cosplay cafe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DCA)
It's much harder for maid cafes which use the cat-eared maid + NyanNyan speak to be successful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E6E)
That is due to differing opinions between the maid cafe maniacs.
<END>

These views are in complete opposition to one another.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041D0)
This establishment is one of the older maid cafes in Akiba, but it leaves a plain and simple impression due to low exposure to the media.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004274)
By the way, all of that Daru's opinion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000432A)
He talks about this stuff so often that I remembered it without even trying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004408)
【Mayuri】Daru-kun, Okarin is here nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004450)
【Itaru】You're late, goddammit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004460)
While sitting in front of me and looking at some other direction, Daru complains.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004470)
The sour look on his face makes him visibly upset.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000448A)
【Itaru】Now, say what you talked about with Faris, in detail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000449A)
【Rintaro】...Do you really want to know? It's not something that you'd understand, anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044AA)
Hell, even I didn't get most of it..
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044BA)
After all, it was just a delusion discharge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044D4)
【Itaru】Aah, so it was the usual, huh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044E4)
【Itaru】The conversations between Faris and Okarin are something that a normal otaku is not able to keep up with. It's like there's an aura around you both.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004504)
【Itaru】You're creating a 2-person <DICT>Reality Marble</DICT> with her...!
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000451E)
I will never forgive you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000453C)
【Mayuri】It's almost like Faris-chan is interested in Okarin nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000454C)
【Mayuri】Out of all the maids and all the myasters that come here, Okarin is the only one who can keep up with Faris-chan's words nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000455C)
Though, even I can't keep up with it too well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000456C)
【Itaru】I am so jelly of Okarin! What a lucky bastard!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000457C)
【Rintaro】Fuh, I have no interest in that lying woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004596)
【Itaru】Is this today's "I don't wanna hear that from you" thread?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045A6)
【Rintaro】Silence, you unfaithful bastard! Your 2D wives are crying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045C0)
【Itaru】Guhaa, that one hit me hard, bro...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045E6)
Daru grabs his chest and unnaturally falls on the table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045F6)
I take a sip of the water that Mayuri left on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004610)
【Mayuri】So, myaster, may I take your order nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004620)
【Rintaro】Omelet rice. And a coffee, black.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000463A)
【Mayuri】Understood NyanNyan♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004656)
After taking my order, Mayuri goes towards counter while tottering between tables as if she was swimming.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004666)
That looked somewhat dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004676)
【Itaru】So, about that business you had with me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000468A)
Daru asked that while still lying on the table
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000469A)
That's right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046AA)
After being confronted by the masseuse and the cat-girl, I almost forgot my real objective.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046F2)
【Itaru】I was gonna go to the lab after 1 hour...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004702)
【Rintaro】I've got something that I want to talk to you about secretly and urgently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004712)
I lean on the table, and reconnoiter the surroundings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004722)
【Rintaro】You do know who John Titor is, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004732)
【Itaru】...John Titor? Who?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004742)
【Rintaro】A self-proclaimed time traveler from the future who appeared in America 10 years ago. I spoke to you about him not so long ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000475C)
【Itaru】You making stuff up again, Okarin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000476C)
【Rintaro】I'm not! All I speak is the truth!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004784)
【Itaru】Haah, <DICT>shit sucks</DICT>. Well, I guess I can play along.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047A6)
【Itaru】So, what's the <DICT>sauce</DICT> on this guy being from the future?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047B6)
【Rintaro】Wait, why are you talking like it's the first you've ever heard of him?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047C6)
【Itaru】Because it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047D6)
【Rintaro】You sure you didn't forget?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047F0)
【Itaru】Dunno about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004800)
【Rintaro】Books about him were released in Japan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004810)
【Itaru】If you show me them, then I might remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004820)
【Rintaro】Wait, you really don't know about him?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000483A)
【Itaru】The memories of people are very vague, you know. They're completely different from digital memory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000484A)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048FA)
This is truly weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000490A)
I might even call this a true abnormality.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000491A)
When I was in senior high, I remember talking with Daru about John Titor. Since it was nothing but a simple chat, it wouldn't be surprising if Daru forgot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000492A)
He is quite an internet addict.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000493A)
However, the internet gives the user the choice of accessing only that information in which he is interested in, and I don't know if Daru looked up information about John Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000494A)
If he says that it's the first time he ever heard of him, there's the possibility that he just never looked him up on the net.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000495A)
Are my memories wrong, or is it the memories of everyone else?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049BE)
【Rintaro】Then, how about "IBN 5100"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049D8)
【Itaru】Heeh, You know that PC, Okarin? Not bad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049E8)
【Rintaro】You know about it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A02)
【Itaru】It's the model that IBN released in 1975.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A12)
Right. That's what John Titor wrote on @channel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A22)
That's why he first went to the year 1975, got the IBN 5100 and then time traveled to 1998.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A32)
【Rintaro】What kind of PC is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A54)
【Itaru】An expensive <DICT>as fuck</DICT> PC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A64)
【Itaru】Ever since the release, it was so expensive that normal people couldn't get their hands on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A74)
【Itaru】That's kinda sad, since it was an excellent PC at that time, and IBN even installed some special features into it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A84)
【Itaru】The "IBN PC" series released in 1981 were a big hit and much more popular than IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A9C)
【Itaru】Still, all the information I know about IBN 5100 is from a <DICT>Wiki</DICT> on the internet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AAC)
【Rintaro】Did you hear the urban legend that one of them is in Akiba?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AC6)
【Itaru】YeaYea, I heard it. It became the talk of the net about a month ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AE8)
【Itaru】And so, several volunteering @channelers explored Akiba's shops while looking for it. My friend from "<DICT>Furepara</DICT>" called Geji-nee was the main person behind that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AF8)
【Itaru】Even that "Lightning-fast Knight-Hart" joined in, but they still couldn't find it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B08)
【Rintaro】So this urban legend was nothing but a rumor, huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B22)
【Itaru】I dunno. There are lots of underground shops in Akiba, so it wouldn't be strange for the IBN 5100 to be hidden in one of the more suspicious ones.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004B32)
【Rintaro】Hmm, I understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004BD4)
My phone starts vibrating while letting out a noise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004BF2)
It stops after about 3 seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C10)
Looks like I got a mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C2E)
I can check it out whenever I want, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C4C)
I'm now talking with Daru, so maybe it would be better if I leave it for afterwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005052)
Hey, hey...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005062)
What's with this mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005072)
Disregarding the weird timing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005088)
Is the sender of this mail and the Shining Finger really the same person?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005098)
Even though we just exchanged addresses, she's being so familiar...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050A8)
The tension is completely different, as well. Does she have a split personality or something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000511A)
Hmm, I am talking with Daru about the IBN 5100 right now, so I guess I should give her a response...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005138)
But, do I really have to give an instant response to a woman I just met?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005156)
I, Hououin Kyouma, am not one to take people lightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005174)
Currently, I have lots of time to think about which choice is better.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005192)
I still have not ascertained if that woman can be trusted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051B0)
But, I believe that I should at least give her a decent response.

I have yet to confirm that that woman is not with the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051EC)
Nonetheless, I should tell her what I just heard from Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000520A)
To discourage her, of course. Fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053DC)
I tell Daru to wait a bit, and start to type words into my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053F8)
It's not like I trust that woman, but I believe that giving her the truth that Daru told me won't do any harm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005408)
It will also make her feel dejected! Fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005622)
Aaand, done.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000566A)
Wha-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000567A)
A response already!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000568A)
No time lag!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000569A)
As expected of Glowing MasseuseShining Finger. The woman whose fingers move at the speed of light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056AA)
Clicking my tongue, I start reading the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000578C)
Damn you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000579C)
As I thought, she's really good at this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000057AC)
I think I got myself into something annoying
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000057BC)
I'd better not give a response to this one...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000057CC)
The minimum requirements have been fulfilled and I have nothing to feel guilty about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000581A)
【Rintaro】Sorry to keep you waiting, Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000582E)
For now, I'll ignore it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000583E)
There's kindness in this action, yes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005886)
【Rintaro】Sorry to keep you waiting, Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058AA)
【Rintaro】Now, I want to confirm one thing--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058BA)
Once again, I look around and lean towards Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058CA)
【Rintaro】IBN 5100 is the item which can trigger the end of the world, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058E4)
【Itaru】Why? It's neither a trigger nor will it end the world, bro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005932)
【Faris】Whyat? You're gonna end the world nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000594E)
Faris brought the omelet rice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000595E)
Such gallant body movements.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000596E)
Even while she's still doing her cat-like antics, the balance of the trays she's holding with single hands does not break.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000597E)
Even with all the NyanNyan stuff, I feel lots of professionalism from Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A06)
【Faris】Myaster, sorry to keep you waiting NyanNyan♪ Your omelet rice is here nya~n!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A20)
After putting the omelet rice on the table, the cat-girl takes out a full ketchup container from a pocket of her apron.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A70)
With it, she flawlessly sprays out the words "The World is in Danger!" on the yellow canvas that is the omelet rice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005ACE)
【Faris】Please enjoy your meal before the world ends♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B94)
【Itaru】Woah, "The World is in Danger!"! Faris-tan's writing is so cute that I'm in danger, too!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005BA4)
Daru loses himself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005BB4)
I try to tell him to calm down via eye language, but to no avail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C8E)
With the bottom of my spoon, I erase the ketchup words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005CB8)
【Itaru】Aah... What a waste...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005CC8)
What do you mean, "waste", I'm eating it either way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005CE2)
【Faris】Daru-nyan Daru-nyan, did I tell you about the "Faris cup" nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005CFC)
【Itaru】Yeah, of course! I will participate, too!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D0C)
【Rintaro】Faris cup? What's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D1C)
I ask that while eating the omelet rice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D36)
【Faris】Nyext Sunday, in this cafe, Faris is hawlding a "Rai-Net" convention nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D46)
Faris is lightly hopping in high spirits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D56)
I wish she wouldn't do that when people are eating nearby.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D66)
【Faris】Faris is the one who coordinates and organizes it, you could awlso call me the one who brought it up nyan!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D80)
【Faris】Kyouma can come as well nyan! Drink included, the price is only 1000 yen. The reward for the one who wins against Faris will be her hand-made food nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005D9A)
【Itaru】No no. Okarin doesn't know much about "Rai-net".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DB4)
【Faris】Nya? But it's interesting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DC4)
【Rintaro】No, I'm fine...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DD4)
I stop eating the omelet rice and let out a small sigh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DE4)
【Rintaro】"Rai-net Access Battlers", huh...? Whenever I hear that, I always remember that person, who was the champion... It's already been 2 years since then...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DF4)
【Rintaro】No, it's nothing. Forget what you just heard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E0E)
【Faris】NyaNya? You we're talking so seriously just neow! Who is "thyat person" nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E1E)
【Itaru】He probably doesn't exist. "Rai-net" officially began only about 1 year ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E2E)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E48)
【Faris】Kyouma, you still cannot forget "thyat person" nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E58)
【Rintaro】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E7A)
【Faris】I remember thyat you and "thyat person"... Faris brother were on very good terms. So good that Faris was jealous nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E8A)
Kuh, dammit. She just "stole" my story...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E9A)
I did not say anything about "that person" being Faris' brother!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005EAA)
Hell, I don't even know if Faris even HAS siblings!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005EBA)
I shouldn't have talked like that in front of her!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005F0A)
【Faris】But, it's time to let go of the past nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005F24)
Her shout resounds through the cafe, and she points her finger at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005F34)
【Faris】Even if it's paynful... No, BECAUSE it is paynful, I accepted brother's dying wish, and have become a "Rai-netter" nyan!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005F4E)
【Faris】Do you remembenya? The words that big brother always used to say, "let's bring peace to the world through Rai-net"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005F96)
【Rintaro】Faris, bring me my coffee.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FB0)
【Faris】NyaNya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FC0)
I hand her over the dish from which I consumed the omelet rice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FD0)
I have a habit of always eating my meals fast. I acquired it due to the long years of being chased by the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FE8)
That's why <DICT>slow food</DICT> can go fuck itself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006038)
【Faris】Understood nya~. It will just be a moment♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000608C)
Faris takes the dish and goes back to the counter while blabbering NyanNyan speak.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000609C)
Ahh, if that went on, I would've had to play along with her delusions for more than 10 minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000060B6)
【Itaru】Faris-tan is a "Rai-netter" of her own tier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000060C6)
Daru explains to me with a bitter smile on his face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000060D6)
【Itaru】She had 400 informal battles, and wasn't beat even once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000060E6)
【Rintaro】What is she, Rickson Gracie?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000060F6)
Daru ignores my retort.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006110)
【Itaru】It's a shame that Faris-tan doesn't join the official tournaments. If she did, then she'd win for sure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006120)
【Rintaro】Well, why doesn't she join?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000613A)
【Itaru】Faris thinks about the customers here first and foremost. She says something along the lines of "If it'd trouble the cafe, then I will not join the tournament". She is a model maid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000614A)
【Itaru】Also, since she is about the same age as Mayushi, she must go to school, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000061F6)
【Rintaro】Since she doesn't want to trouble the cafe, she's organizing the "Faris Cup", right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000062A4)
【Itaru】That don't matter at all!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006352)
【Itaru】The point is that Faris is cute. Cute is justice. Cat-eared maids are sexually outrageous. That's all that matters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063F6)
【Rintaro】So are you into 2D or 3D? Decide already.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000064A4)
【Itaru】Double the dimension, double the fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000655A)
【Rintaro】You sure are carefree, Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006588)
【Itaru】Well said. <DICT>Soz</DICT> about that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006598)
Daru doesn't usually show any motivation, but he sure gets fired up in such situations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065A8)
I really wish that he'd apply some of this enthusiasm to our lab activities.
