Daru and I stop thinking about the problems concerning the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and head towards <DICT>Daibiru</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000093C)
Later today we must participate in a seminar at <DICT>ATF</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E0)
The ATF acts as an industrial-academic co-op link for the Tokyo Electric University that Daru and I go to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A84)
It holds the summer short courses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B28)
We won't get points if we don't write a report on this seminar so we are compelled to participate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BCC)
Speaking of which what was the subject of this symposium again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C70)
I looked into it once before the summer holidays began but I forgot it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D14)
【Reporter】An unidentified large object has crashed into a building in front of the Akihabara station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB8)
【Reporter】Currently the area is restricted by the police and it's forbidden to go in front of the building but if you look at the object from a distance it resembles a space satellite!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E5C)
I throw a glance down from the overpass which connects UPX and Daibiru and it looks like there are more people than usual today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F00)
There are also some weird-looking teenagers among them and they definitely don't seem like people who would normally visit Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA4)
They all seem to be going towards the Central Street which is still off limits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001048)
【Rintaro】Daru won't you go to the Radio Center for some sightseeing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001124)
【Itaru】Even if I go there I won't be able to see it. And I'm constantly monitoring the net for any news about it. The number of threads on @chan has already exceeded 100!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DA)
Oh so that's why he was staring at his phone while walking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
Upon entering Daibiru we take the elevator towards the ATF assembly hall at the 5th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A4)
【Itaru】Ahhh... it's so cool. I'm coming back to life. abababababa...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B4)
There's air conditioning in Daibiru so this is like an oasis for us poor university students.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C4)
There's more than one reason for why were going to ATF to participate in this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E2)
【Rintaro】We might acquire some answers to the problems concerning the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F2)
【Itaru】It's annoying so can you stop using the "(Temp)" already?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001302)
That will not shake my resolution. Even if no other lab members say it I will keep using it until I decide on a better name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001320)
【Rintaro】Right now that doesn't matter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001330)
【Itaru】So did you come up with some ridiculous theory again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001340)
【Rintaro】What do you mean ridiculous? I have already transcended everything in this world and am thinking about the infinite possibilities... Don't you dare call that ridiculous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000135E)
【Itaru】By "transcended all the things in nature" you mean that you're talking about whatever you want huh? I wouldn't even call that theorizing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000136E)
【Rintaro】Daru I believe that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) might be the key that will open the Steins;Gate. What do you make of that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137E)
【Itaru】That Stein-whatever doesn't even have a proper meaning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FA)
We hear a ringing sound which indicates that we have reached the 5th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140A)
The sensation of being lifted upwards disappears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141A)
The elevator doors slowly open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142A)
At the same time that I get out of the elevator--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001644)
【Kurisu?】Kyah--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001654)
I bump into a person.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001664)
I quickly grab the person's shoulder to support her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001674)
【Kurisu?】Excuse me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D0)
【Rintaro】Ah...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E0)
I recognize---
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F0)
This woman's face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171A)
【Rintaro】Ah... ah...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172A)
I enter a state of shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173A)
Chills run down my spine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174A)
I can't even move my fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175A)
My gaze is fixed on the face of the person in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176A)
Her innocence makes her seem like a girl rather than a woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177A)
I already looked at this graceful face about 3 hours ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000181E)
Makise... Kurisu...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000182E)
【Kurisu】Uhm... is there a problem?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001858)
Kurisu makes a puzzled face and tries to get away from me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)
However I don't let go of her shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001878)
Instead I put more strength to my grip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
【Kurisu】O-ow...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001898)
【Rintaro】Y-you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A8)
【Rintaro】You should be dead! Why are you here!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B8)
【Rintaro】And...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E2)
Her clothes are the same she wore that time and they're completely clean.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F2)
No matter how much I stare at them it doesn't look like she's injured anywhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001902)
With that amount of bleeding she must've had a heavy wound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001912)
【Rintaro】Unharmed...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001922)
【Kurisu】W- it hurts...! Let go...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C84)
Kurisu pushes me away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C94)
Then she glares at me with a vigilant look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA4)
She doesn't seem like an injured person at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB4)
【Kurisu】...What?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC4)
【Rintaro】You're alright? Your wounds are fine? No that's impossible! Makise Kurisu was stabbed and lying in a pool of blood she--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D0C)
【Itaru】That story again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D1C)
The one who cut me off was Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D2C)
And he just said something weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3C)
【Rintaro】What do you mean by that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4C)
【Itaru】You sent me a mail like that a week ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D5C)
【Rintaro】A mail? Me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D6C)
【Rintaro】Don't be absurd! I saw that Makise Kurisu was killed just about 3 hours ago!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
【Kurisu】Hey. Please don't just kill me off okay? I'm perfectly alive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DA0)
【Itaru】Speaking of which that mail was very weird. The date said that it was sent "after" 1 week. Which implies that it came from the future...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DF0)
【Kurisu】Came from the future?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E00)
【Rintaro】Did you check out some weird website Daru? It's unusual for you to spout ridiculous theories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E1E)
【Itaru】I'm not! The date definitely said that it came from after 1 week! Uhm that's uh 28th...
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E38)
Ah right! The 28th is today!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4C)
Daru hurriedly operates his phone and shows it to me after a few seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E94)
Surely that's a mail from me to Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EA4)
Receipt date: July 21st 12:56
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB4)
Sending date: July 28th 12:54
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC4)
The mail is split in 3.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED4)
The 1st one says "Someone stab"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE4)
The 2nd one says "bed Makise K"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF4)
The 3rd one says "urisu. Don't"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F04)
Why did I send such a short message in 3 parts?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F14)
It also looks like the 3rd one was cut off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F24)
I have no memories of sending such short mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F34)
But I recognize the content.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F84)
【Rintaro】This is... The mail I sent 3 hours ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F94)
However I sent a single mail not 3. And I entered more words than this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA4)
Did Daru actually receive this 1 week ago? On the 21st?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC4)
【Kurisu】Very interesting...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD4)
Wait when did she get here? Kurisu is glaring at the screen of the cellphone with a serious look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002098)
Oh right! The mail doesn't matter! Well maybe it does but not now!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020A8)
Currently the more important question is "why is she perfectly fine!?".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B8)
Is this an illusion!? No a ghost!? Have I been cursed or something!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C8)
As a mad scientist I refuse to believe such unscientific things!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
I timidly extend my hand towards Kurisu's face...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F6)
...and touch her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002306)
I can actually feel the cuticles her silk-like hair.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002316)
【Rintaro】Sh-she's here and I can touch her... To think that I just thought that she's a ghost... How silly of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000233C)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234C)
【Itaru】O-Okarin... Ain't that a bit dangerous?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023EE)
I keep poking Kurisu's cheek with my finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023FE)
Such wonderful softness and skin tension. It's completely different from a dead bod- wait I never actually touched one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002418)
【Kurisu】...Hey
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002428)
Anyway I already touched her shoulder when we bumped into each other and when she pushed me away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002438)
My assumption that she has no body is nothing but proof that I'm in a state of confusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002448)
Then what was that gruesome scene I saw in the Radio Center? What exactly was that man's scream I heard?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002458)
Was that series of events an illusion just like the mass disappearance?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002468)
That's right wounds! If that was real then the Makise Kurisu right here must have injuries!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002478)
I must investigate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000251A)
I grab the edge of her clothes and slowly try to to move them aside--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C6)
【Kurisu】Do you want cops coming after you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D6)
【Rintaro】...I just want to find out the truth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E6)
While Makise Kurisu is shaking with anger I return her a direct gaze and move her jacket aside--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002600)
【Kurisu】What's that all about you PERVERT!? Are you stupid!? Do you want to die!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C8)
She pushes my hand aside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
【Itaru】That's <DICT>Louise-chan</DICT>'s famous line!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F2)
I ignore Daru's screaming and continue talking without flinching.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002702)
【Rintaro】I'm perfectly sure that I saw it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000271C)
【Kurisu】Wait! Did you just saw my underw...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000272C)
Kurisu's face reddens as she quickly tries to cover herself up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000273C)
【Rintaro】You imbecile! That's not it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002756)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027D6)
Noon today after the ending of Doctor Nakabachi's presentation Makise Kurisu was killed by someone and lied in a pool of blood--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027E6)
I give her a thorough explanation of that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000286C)
【Kurisu】Eh? Doctor... Nakabachi...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B4)
【Itaru】What are you talking about Okarin? Nakabachi's presentation was cancelled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C4)
【Rintaro】...Cancelled?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D4)
【Itaru】Yep. Because of the satellite crashing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E4)
Once again the things I've seen and what others tell me are completely different...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F4)
It's the same as the conversation I had with Mayuri after the mass disappearance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002904)
I'm feeling uneasy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002914)
Did I get myself involved in something outrageous?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002924)
Is this another conspiracy of the Organization?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000293E)
【Kurisu】Hey you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000294E)
【Rintaro】M-my name is Hououin Kyouma!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002968)
【Itaru】But that's wrong completely...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002978)
【Kurisu】Hououin-san would you kindly tell me about what you just said in more detail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002988)
Looks like she now understands that I'm not lying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002998)
Even so I don't know why what I know and what others know doesn't match so I doubt that I can give her a good explanation--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B4)
A middle-aged man shows his face from the small conference room at the inner part of this floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C4)
【Professor】Makise-san it's about to begin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029DE)
【Kurisu】Eh? Uhm yes...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029FA)
Kurisu throws me a glare takes a deep breath and heads towards the small conference room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A42)
【Itaru】Okarin let's just go for now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A52)
【Rintaro】Go? What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A6C)
【Itaru】We came here to listen to a lecture genius.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A7C)
Oh right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A98)
Daru goes to the same place where Kurisu just went.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA8)
So she came to listen to the same lecture as us?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB8)
...That girl genius?
