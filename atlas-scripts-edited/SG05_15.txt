After that, nobody tried to touch the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007D8)
It might blow your memories into the past just by touching it--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007E8)
That's how we felt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F8)
Though it's absurd, of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000808)
I might become humanity's first time leaper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000818)
That curiosity couldn't kill the fear of the unknown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000828)
Just how should we react to that fear--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000838)
Before we knew it, we talked about having a small celebration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000848)
We kinda feel the need to let loose after working all night.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000858)
Nobody opposed the notion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A98)
I have Daru order pizza while Kurisu and I go out shopping for snacks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA8)
Akiba has a severe lack of supermarkets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
It's the same even after the moe shops disappeared and turned the town retro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AC8)
After we finish shopping, Kurisu and I walk along the evening Akiba streets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B10)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B20)
Kurisu's been walking next to me for a while, looking like she wants to say something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B30)
She keeps stealing glances at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B40)
【Rintaro】Dissatisfied?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5A)
【Kurisu】Dissatisfied?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B6A)
Doesn't look like she expected that word from me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B7A)
Finally, she faces this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B8A)
【Rintaro】Dissatisfied that we're not experimenting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA4)
【Kurisu】No way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB4)
【Kurisu】"Humans are temporal beings".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC4)
【Kurisu】That's a Heidegger quote.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD4)
【Kurisu】When you decided we won't experiment, I was actually relieved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BE4)
【Kurisu】If nobody came to stop me, then I might not have been able to stop myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BF4)
【Kurisu】Thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C04)
Oh, ohh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C14)
It's a rare, admirable gratitude.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C24)
Does she have a fever?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C74)
Kurisu twitches when I put my hand to her forehead to check.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C84)
【Kurisu】Hey, what are you doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C94)
【Rintaro】I thought you might have a fever since you're saying such assistant-like words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE4)
I drop my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF4)
【Kurisu】It's not like I'm grateful for you or anything, okay!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D04)
Kurisu attracts the attention of all the surrounding pedestrians with that line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1E)
Kurisu hangs her blushing head once she notices.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2E)
If Daru were here, he'd probably get all excited and say A real tsundere ftw!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D48)
【Kurisu】Anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF4)
Kurisu clears her throat, returning to her usual sour face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E98)
【Kurisu】That thanks was just a formality. Don't get me wrong, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3C)
【Rintaro】Like hell I'd get you wrong. 'Cause I've only done what was natural.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FE0)
【Rintaro】For as Lab Member 001 and founder of the lab, I, Hououin Kyouma, place highest priority on protecting the welfare of my lab mems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001084)
【Rintaro】So I have no need for your thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001128)
【Kurisu】And yet you say things like visiting chaos upon the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011CC)
【Rintaro】My lab mems are my allies, and the world is my enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000127A)
【Kurisu】I'm speechless. You're too self-righteous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131E)
【Rintaro】Speechless, yet you're speaking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CC)
【Kurisu】Don't be a grammar Nazi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001470)
It's mysterious if you think about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001514)
It's still just been two weeks since Kurisu and I met.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B8)
And yet it's become normal for her to be next to me as a lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000165C)
Though we may have been shackled together when we made that outrageous object.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001700)
This genius girl's wealth of knowledge sure is wonderful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A4)
I'd like her to stay at the lab by all means, but she said she's going to return to America this month. It's already the 13th, so I wonder when she plans to return.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001852)
【Kurisu】Oh yeah, I forgot to get a plane ticket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F6)
That's how she answered when I asked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199A)
【Kurisu】I got too caught up in improving the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3E)
【Rintaro】If we publicly reveal the Time Leap Machine, it'll put the world in an uproar. We also need to prosecute SERN. You'll be unable to go back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF4)
【Kurisu】Ah, I see. I need to call Mama in case that happens.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B10)
Looks like things are gong to get busy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B20)
Naturally, I want Kurisu to stay with us to the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C68)
A little bit after we return to the lab, Mayuri gets back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB4)
【Mayuri】Tutturu-♪ I'm back-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EDA)
Seems Mayuri went to Lukako's.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF2)
Our <DICT>development council</DICT> starts, with Suzuha also participating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002010)
Daru ordered three pizzas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002020)
We also lined up all the snacks we bought on the table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002030)
It's the same scene as the party we had to cheer up Suzuha a few days ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002040)
It seems like Mayuri wanted to decorate the room, but since everyone's tired, I dismissed it as unnecessary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002088)
Seems like Suzuha safely secured her sweater from Manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002098)
【Suzuha】Man-, that was terrible. I got stuck with acting like an exhibitionist for an entire day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B4)
The Braun Tube Workshop's already closed for today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C4)
I checked with Suzuha to make sure the 42in Braun tube TV's off, so there's no need to fear failure from the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020D4)
Upon hearing that, I take a big sigh and free my body from the stress.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020E4)
Then I notice that I've been nervous these five hours since the Time Leap Machine's been complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002184)
Even when we started the development council, Kurisu didn't touch the topic of the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002194)
That topic is taboo in this party. It's become that sort of atmosphere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
【Rintaro】Daru, why did you order the exact same pizza as before!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021EC)
I had opened the delivered pizza boxes to find the exact same ones as for Suzuha's party.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021FC)
【Itaru】Because, I like it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000220C)
Naturally, I'm shocked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
【Mayuri】Okarin, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000226E)
【Mayuri】I called Faris-chan and Luka-chan too, but they said they couldn't join today-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000227E)
【Rintaro】I see. Did they have things to do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002298)
【Mayuri】Faris-chan has a RaiNet tournament today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B2)
【Itaru】Crap, I should've cheered her on! How careless of me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022C2)
【Mayuri】And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002312)
【Kurisu】Maybe she thinks you'll make her wear a costume if she comes here again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002322)
【Rintaro】The cosplay stuff? You still haven't convinced her yet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002332)
Then what was the point in completing the costume?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234C)
【Mayuri】She said it was embarrassing. Even though "Cute is Justice"-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002366)
【Kurisu】"Cute is Justice"... that phrase is getting popular.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002380)
【Mayuri】Chris-chan, you're cute too-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000239A)
【Kurisu】Hah? Eh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023AA)
Kurisu's surprised at the sudden turn of events.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023BA)
Mayuri starts teasing the blushing Kurisu like a nasty old drunkard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023CA)
Figuratively speaking, of course, since there's no alcohol at this party.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023E4)
【Mayuri】Heyhey, wanna go to this coming ComiMa-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023F4)
【Mayuri】I can't make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for Chris-chan too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000240E)
【Kurisu】Me, cosplay...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000241E)
Kurisu makes a difficult face, and then murmurs--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002438)
【Kurisu】I'm sorta interested.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002448)
Bitch, you didn't look interested at all before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002458)
【Kurisu】Ah, but I refuse to do it in public, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002472)
【Mayuri】It's okay to just wear it-. But you know, eventually, you'll want everyone to see. The cosplay demon compels you-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002482)
Demon...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000249C)
【Mayuri】That reminds me. Chris-chan, you're always wearing that cute uniform, huh-. But was there a uniform like this in metro Tokyo-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B6)
【Kurisu】Ah, this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C6)
Kurisu pulls up her necktie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024DE)
【Kurisu】For just two weeks, I did something like an abroad study at <DICT>Ayamein</DICT>, and so I modeled this after their uniform.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F8)
【Mayuri】Ah-, so it was Ayamein-. Their uniform is originally cute huh-. But Chris-chan's modeling sense might be really good~♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002508)
【Mayuri】Tomorrow, I'll bring the costume, okay? Then will you try it on-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002522)
【Kurisu】Yeah. Okay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002532)
Looks like Kurisu approves of the message of Cute is Justice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002582)
【Itaru】When's the photo session?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259C)
【Kurisu】And of course, Hashida's always working hard on the pervert road, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025AC)
【Itaru】Come on, it's Blood Tune's Seira, right!? She's got panmoro going on, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025BC)
【Kurisu】Panmoro?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D6)
【Itaru】It means you can see MORe O' her PANties.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F0)
【Kurisu】Eh, no way...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002640)
【Mayuri】It's okay-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002650)
【Mayuri】Chris-chan might not know this, but last year, this phrase was really popular.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000266A)
【Mayuri】They're not panties so it's not embarrassing!'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002684)
【Kurisu】No, no, it-it's embarrassing, right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002694)
【Mayuri】Absolutely wear it, okay? Absolutely-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026AA)
【Suzuha】Maybe you should just stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000278A)
Forcing her way through with a sharp voice is Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000279A)
She scowls at Kurisu like usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027AA)
The formerly fun atmosphere freezes in an instant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000280E)
【Suzuha】If you believe in Makise Kurisu, you'll get into trouble.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000281E)
【Kurisu】What do you mean by that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000282E)
And there's also my usual assistant, Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000283E)
Naturally, she shows no signs of running from the fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000284E)
Sparks begin to fly between the two girls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000285E)
【Kurisu】I've been thinking for a while, but, have I done anything to you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000286E)
【Suzuha】Nothing directly. But I know everything you've done.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000287E)
【Kurisu】What do mean everything I've done? I've done nothing to be guilty of.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288E)
【Suzuha】Sure thing. But I know. I know your true nature.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000289E)
【Kurisu】Hmm, amazing. You can peek into my heart? That's a ground-breaking invention, so please, show me by all means.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028AE)
【Suzuha】There is no device. If I'm forced to say, then it's a prediction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028BE)
【Kurisu】So basically, you're all talk, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028CE)
【Suzuha】But it's the "truth".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028DE)
We've got a situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028EE)
【Mayuri】Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028FE)
Mayuri clings to me with teary eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000290E)
【Mayuri】Stop them-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291E)
【Rintaro】Hehehe, seems like the only one who can bring peace in this situation is I, Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292E)
I step between them, grab their shoulders and separate them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029BE)
【Rintaro】Break it up you two! For I, Hououin Kyouma, shall decide this dispute!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029CE)
They glare at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029DE)
Though flinching, I endure it without exposing my weakness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029EE)
First, I focus on Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA2)
【Rintaro】Assistant, I don't remember raising you to be like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB2)
【Kurisu】I don't remember you raising me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC2)
【Rintaro】Let me tell you the most important thing to be a mad scientist. Namely, "hot on the outside, cold on the inside"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AD2)
【Kurisu】I didn't ask. I don't want to be one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE2)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B60)
Next, I switch focus to Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C14)
【Rintaro】O Warrior, you should be fighting "Ragnarok" against SERN, not her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C24)
【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro, I've warned you, haven't I? To be careful of Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C34)
【Rintaro】Hey
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C44)
You're going to talk about that here, now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C54)
【Kurisu】Hehhh... What's this about, Okabe?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD2)
I wanted to run away from their cold glances staring daggers at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE2)
But Mayuri's watching anxiously. I need to fulfill her request somehow or another!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF2)
【Rintaro】Fuuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D02)
【Rintaro】Looks like neither of you guys wants to pull back, huh. Then fight each other to your heart's content. Fight, and fight, and fight to the bitter end! Then after that, share a manly handshake by the river and let friendship blossom!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D12)
【Rintaro】But, in the future, when you go out into the public, just be aware of this one thing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D22)
【Rintaro】You two just can't read the atmosphere!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D3A)
【Kurisu&Suzuha (K)】Shut up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D4A)
【Kurisu&Suzuha (S)】Shut up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D5E)
Getting told by both of them at the same time sends chills down my spine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D6E)
I endure by gripping my right wrist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D7E)
【Rintaro】Gwahh... now, of all times...! Calm down, right hand of mine...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DDC)
Then, I take a right about-face and head back to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E70)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, I'm sorry, at his rate, I'll hurt those two, so... I'll leave the rest to you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E8A)
【Mayuri】Geez--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E9A)
Mayuri puffs her cheeks out to contain her anger, and intervenes in my place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EB4)
【Mayuri】Listen you two-. Mayushii doesn't like it when you fight. Let's all get along-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EC4)
Then, the two of them reluctantly comply.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ED4)
As expected of the oil to our group's gears. It's because Mayuri's a lab mem that things don't go crazy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE4)
The throbbing in my right arm dissipates.
