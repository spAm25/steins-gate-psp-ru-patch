The next day. I decide to go around the parts shops.

Yesterday, after parting with Kurisu, I walked around looking at the shops throughout Akiba until dark, but to no result.

I expected obtaining the IBN 5100 would be fairly difficult. It already feels tedious.

【Rintaro】Uuummm....

Radio Center's narrow passage. Lined up on the left and right are small parts shops.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000262)
Here are the old vestiges of the bygone Electric Town, Akiba's conscience, so to speak.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000272)
Light otaku who like anime or large appliances don't readily set foot here.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000282)
It's like a holy ground were only true maniacs can enter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000292)
By the way, I'm not too well-acquainted with parts either...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A2)
Furthermore, the parts shops only sell parts, so it's not like there would be a large retro PC laying around here. I didn't consider that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B2)
And yet I've still been rummaging through the lined up parts in excitement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C2)
If the shops' geezers yell "Hey, kid! You're ten years too early for this!" and I'd have no choice but to run.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D2)
At present, the geezers don't seem like they'll yell at me. It's more like they're ignoring me. Or maybe they're just annoyed at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E2)
Hiding that excitement, I examine each store with dignity, but I can't find hide nor hair of the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003BC)
The shop geezer glares at me at the sound of my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DA)
I force a smile and rush outside.
