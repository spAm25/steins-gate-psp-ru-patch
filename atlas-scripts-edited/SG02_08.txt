I tried looking for information in an internet cafe for about an hour, but to no result.

I indulge in thoughts while drinking mango juice with tapioca that I bought from a juice stand inside Yodobashi.

It's Saturday, so the front of the station's starting to get crowded.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000234)
Some maids hand out leaflets to the people coming out of the station.

Is there anybody well-acquainted with retro PCs other than Daru?

That reminds me, that Shining Finger was devoted to the IBN 5100, wasn't she?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C6)
I'm reluctant to contact that mail demon, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E4)
Though I realize reluctance has no relevance when the outcome of the crusade is at stake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000472)
I don't know Masseuse's phone number, so I decide to mail her for the time being.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000664)
I finish drinking the mango juice with tapioca, and aimlessly head towards Chuo Dori.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000772)
And then a mail comes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000882)
The sender is Shining Finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000892)
Such a quick response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A2)
But I asked her to call, so why did she reply with a mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D4)
In the end, I finish drinking the mango juice without making contact.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E4)
I aimlessly head towards Chuo Dori.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B9A)
Then, almost as if on cue, a mail comes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB8)
Could it be... the mail demon?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D10)
Tch, it's like she can read my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2E)
I instinctively survey my surroundings while walking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3E)
I try looking for that gloomy face, but can't find her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB8)
Oh well. Should I reply?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9E)
I don't know Masseuse's phone number, so I decide to mail her for the time being.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F96)
I ask her to call, and include my phone number, as I send.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A2)
Now I just have to wait for her response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001144)
And, a reply soon comes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001248)
Such a quick response.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001258)
But I asked her to call, so why did she reply with a mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001308)
By mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001318)
It's such complicated talk, so why do I have to use such a tedious method?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001328)
I need to find out her phone number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B6)
"Tell me your phone number. And also any information you've got on the IBN 5100."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141A)
Now I'll send this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C8)
When I look up after finishing the mail, there's a huge crowd of people.

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D8)
Like always, a lot of people are in front of Radio Kaikan, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E8)
The mass media hasn't died down since the crash day either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F8)
Radio Kaikan is still closed today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001554)
Of course, the satellite's still there too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159C)
The reply comes after not even 30 seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001630)
Right as I'm about to look down at my mail, I catch sight of a familiar face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001640)
【Kurisu】Ah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B0)
【Rintaro】Assistant? What are you doing here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CA)
【Kurisu】Hey. When did I become your assistant?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016DA)
She looks like she'll snap at me, so to dampen her spirit, I go back to checking my mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172C)
That bitch...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001746)
I told her to tell me her phone number and she just ignored me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001756)
And she doesn't even have any information! There are limits to uselessness!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001766)
【Kurisu】...Why are you glaring at me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001784)
【Rintaro】Don't mind it. You're not the cause of my frustration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179E)
【Kurisu】An outburst of anger? Don't glare.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AE)
【Rintaro】You've glared at me several times too, haven't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C8)
【Kurisu】That's because you're PERVE--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E2)
【Kurisu】Ah, no, I'm not saying anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000188C)
Tch, that again....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F0)
I wanted to snap my phone in half and throw it at the ground.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A00)
What do you mean "Tell me♪!?" You making fun of me with that "♪"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A10)
More importantly, why does she send me two short consecutive mails like that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A20)
I mean, she might as well just send them as one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A3A)
【Kurisu】Are the mails you're getting that unpleasant?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A4A)
【Rintaro】They're more unconventional than unpleasant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5A)
I'm not satisfied calling it by one word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE8)
Stop sending me bits and pieces of mail. I'm begging you, so please send them together!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BEE)
After sending that mail, I'm a little satisfied.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C04)
I turn to Kurisu again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C14)
【Rintaro】So, Christina, what are you doing here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2E)
【Kurisu】I'd like you to at least call me something consistently.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C3E)
【Kurisu】...But it doesn't really matter what I'm here for, does it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4E)
【Rintaro】What? Why are you pouting?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C68)
【Kurisu】I'm not pouting. But, I don't want to get involved with you any more than what's necessary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C78)
【Rintaro】What nonsense. You're already a lab mem, you know. You need to work for the benefit of the lab, or we'll be in trouble.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C88)
Though, she is only a provisional member.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
No, it's because she's a provisional member that we need her to invest as much of her knowledge in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA8)
【Kurisu】...I hate myself for losing to curiosity back then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC4)
Kurisu sighs while looking up to the satellite above.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CD4)
Not just us, but several other people are standing still here, looking up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE4)
It's become a new tourist spot in Akiba.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF4)
【Rintaro】Did you come to see the satellite?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3C)
【Kurisu】...I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D56)
【Kurisu】Don't you think it's unbelievable? Normally, satellites are calculated to burn up in the atmosphere during orbit when they fall. How can it be in that good condition?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D66)
And that's even despite the huge hole it opened up in the building....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D76)
I wonder if satellites are really that strong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
If I had to say, I'd say they seem more brittle than strong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D96)
【Rintaro】Where's this satellite from in the first place?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DB0)
【Kurisu】We still don't know. There are rumors it's something from the former Soviet Union, but Russia denies it. Thanks to that, it looks like they can't remove it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC0)
Three days have passed and it's still unknown. How interesting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD0)
I smell a conspiracy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DE0)
【Rintaro】I see, so this is the work of the "Organization" too...! To erase me, who was at Radio Kaikan at that time!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DFA)
【Kurisu】"Organization"? What's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E0A)
【Rintaro】The "Organization" is the "Organization". Its formal name is something else, but all those who know of its existence call it the 'Organization' out of fear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E1A)
【Rintaro】Manipulating the world from the shadows, they are a secret organization transcending national borders, with politics, economics, religion, and everything else in their grasp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E34)
【Kurisu】Thanks for the conspiracy theory. Now cat hiss at--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4E)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E5E)
For some reason, Kurisu hangs her head as she blushes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E6E)
【Rintaro】What's wrong?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E7E)
【Kurisu】N-nothing's wrong. Really, nothing, okay? No more questioning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E8E)
Strange woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E9E)
【Kurisu】M-more importantly, how was the Microwave Ophone!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EAE)
【Rintaro】Why are you that interested? By the way, it's not the Microwave Ophone, it's the Microwave Ophone (Temp)--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EC8)
【Kurisu】Just answer me. How was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED8)
【Rintaro】...No progress. We tried repeating the experiment, but at present, we haven't reproduced that discharge phenomenon, nor returned a mail to the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE8)
【Kurisu】I see....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F8A)
Another mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA8)
Damn Masseuse, I told her not to send so many brief mails, but she doesn't understand yet?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC6)
I can't handle this mail demon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F8)
Looks like she's rethinking things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002108)
Hopefully I don't have to worry about any more mail attacks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002158)
【Kurisu】Hallo-? Could you put away your phone when you're talking with someone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002176)
【Rintaro】Don't say that. I'm reforming the mail demon, so you should acknowledge my efforts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021C6)
【Kurisu】Why are you so pompous...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021D6)
【Rintaro】I'd like to ask you the same thing, Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021F0)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000222A)
With that said, let's reply to Masseuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022B8)
"As long as you understand. I'm also looking for an IBN 5100. Let's exchange information from now on. You don't need to reply to this mail."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000231C)
I type that out and send it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023DA)
【Kurisu】Are you done with your mail exchange? Hououin-san?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023EA)
【Rintaro】Hoh, so you remember my true name, huh. Indeed, my name is Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002404)
【Kurisu】I said it sarcastically.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002414)
【Rintaro】How was that sarcastic? You said my name correctly. There's nothing wrong. That's a good attitude as an assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002424)
【Kurisu】Okabe-san, you're crazy, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002434)
【Rintaro】I am not Okabe!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244E)
【Kurisu】I'm tired of talking to you....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002462)
Let's check the mail later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000247C)
【Kurisu】You're pompous, but it looks like you know your manners at least.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000248C)
【Rintaro】What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A6)
【Kurisu】I hate people who play with their phones while talking to others.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B6)
【Rintaro】I see, so that's why you forcibly took my phone when we first met.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D0)
【Kurisu】When we first met? I didn't do that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E0)
【Rintaro】Yeah you did. When I was making my periodic report, you grabbed my--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F0)
Phone out of my hand. Before I finish talking, I shut my mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002500)
The events at Radio Kaikan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002510)
My story of what happened back then doesn't mesh with Daru's and Mayuri's, and now Kurisu's stories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002520)
So was that a dream or an illusion after all...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000253A)
【Kurisu】What? What do you mean by periodic report?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000254A)
【Rintaro】No. It's nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000255E)
【Rintaro】So, about the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258A)
【Rintaro】After the experiment, you screamed something like "Time machines are a lie!". Did you recall a past trauma?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025A4)
【Kurisu】Hey, you. Don't just give me traumas like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025B4)
【Rintaro】I see. That was back when you were 5 years old. Christina was in an Arkansas plain when lightning--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025CE)
【Kurisu】I wasn't hit by lightning! And I was still living in Japan when I was five. Anyway, why Arkansas?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025DE)
【Rintaro】When I was trying to imagine tranquil scenery, the first state name to come to mind was Arkansas, and the next one was Oregon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F8)
【Kurisu】Not Utah? Relatively speaking, isn't Utah more suitable?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002608)
【Rintaro】Then answer me, Christina! Why did you say "lie" back then!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002622)
【Kurisu】...It's not like I said it with any particular conviction. My logic was simply that I didn't want to believe. There's enough fringe science in novels and movies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002632)
【Rintaro】Fringe science? What nonsense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002642)
【Rintaro】You should've seen it clearly too. The phenomenon of the mail flying into the past! The instant the banana teleported!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002652)
【Kurisu】...I saw, but something must be wrong. Or possibly, we're just making convenient explanations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002662)
【Kurisu】Didn't I say so at ATF? Time machines are just a pipe dream with today's technology.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000267C)
【Kurisu】And that's to say nothing of a playtime club like you guys, who made junk just by connecting a phone to a microwave and expect time travel to occur.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000268C)
【Rintaro】But it actually occurred. How can you deny what you saw with your own eyes? Are you saying theories are more correct than reality? Then just live out your whole life using sophistry and word play.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000269C)
【Kurisu】What do you mean by word play?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026AC)
【Rintaro】Quantum theory and the likes seem like nothing but word play to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C6)
【Kurisu】...Wait, are you trying to deny modern physics? Who do you think you are?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D6)
【Rintaro】Phenomena are straightforward. What happens is everything; what doesn't happen, what isn't observed is nothing but a hypothesis.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E6)
【Kurisu】When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become real.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F6)
【Kurisu】That's how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002706)
【Rintaro】But there are also cases where hypotheses are mistaken. Even Einstein was wrong about some things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002720)
【Kurisu】So just because they could be mistaken, you're going to do nothing? Then just live out your whole life playing king locked up in that dirty building of yours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002730)
【Kurisu】You'll never reach the truth that way. Failure teaches success.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002740)
【Rintaro】I see. Nice rebuttal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002750)
【Kurisu】...You're never getting off your high horse, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002760)
【Rintaro】By the way, Christina, I've always felt this. That physicists are contradictory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000277A)
【Kurisu】...Contradictory?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000278A)
【Rintaro】There certainly are phenomena that everyone knows occur in reality, yet physicists haven't begun work on elucidating. What do you think about that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027A4)
【Kurisu】I don't know unless you can cite examples.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027B4)
【Rintaro】Ghosts, for instance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CE)
【Kurisu】The occult...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027DE)
【Rintaro】You're going to give up thinking because it's the occult? That contradicts what you just said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027EE)
【Rintaro】"You'll never reach the truth that way."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002808)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002818)
【Rintaro】People who have seen ghosts certainly exist. Photographic evidence also exists.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002828)
【Rintaro】However, why doesn't anyone continue turning over new hypotheses?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002838)
【Kurisu】...It's a different field of study.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002848)
【Rintaro】The study of unelucidated phenomena be damned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002858)
【Kurisu】...True, but
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002868)
【Rintaro】With that said, we should accurately inspect the phenomenon of sending mail into the past. Assistant, lend me your power.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002882)
【Kurisu】No.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002892)
Kurisu answers clearly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028A2)
She glares as she usually does.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B2)
So this genius girl really does hate me, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C2)
【Kurisu】I won't have a hand in fringe science. I won't make the same mistake my father did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D2)
【Rintaro】Father...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E2)
【Kurisu】Your line of thought is okay to express verbally, but it doesn't hold in the academic society.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F2)
【Kurisu】The day you decide to research time travel theory is the day you're out a job.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002902)
【Rintaro】How can you say it that certainly?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002912)
【Kurisu】That's how my father was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002928)
Kurisu grinds her teeth.
<END>

【Kurisu】My physicist father loved time machines. He was fascinated by Wells' "The Time Machine" and seriously studied them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000295E)
【Kurisu】But since he was too obsessed, he was nearly banished from the academic society.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002978)
【Kurisu】Since I saw that happen to my father, I don't want to get involved with time travel research...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002988)
Her sheer force puts me to shame this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A26)
Umm, did I get her seriously mad?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A36)
I feel like I stepped on an unexpected land mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A46)
What do I do? If I get her any angrier, she could sting me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A56)
Let's calm her down a little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A66)
Let's do that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A76)
Umm, how should I talk to her...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE4)
【Kurisu】...I'm sorry. I got emotional.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AF4)
She apologizes first.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B04)
Christina's calm nature saves me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B14)
【Rintaro】Fuhahaha! Don't worry about it! I wanted to test your nature, so I purposefully made you angry!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B2E)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B48)
【Kurisu】...Anyway, the Microwave Ophone isn't a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B58)
【Kurisu】Mail transmission is a man made system, so it should be a phenomenon explainable in the scope of that system.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B68)
【Rintaro】...I understand how you think, Assistant. You hate time machines that much. Your reaction was like an allergy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B82)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B92)
【Rintaro】I'm sorry to trouble you by forcing you to become a lab mem. You don't have to come again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BA2)
【Kurisu】...Even if you don't tell me, I won't come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BB2)
【Rintaro】But, I will tell you this. Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BCC)
【Kurisu】Don't say Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BDC)
【Rintaro】Lab Mem Number 004 will be a retired number. That number... is yours forever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C58)
Ending the speech, I turn my back to Kurisu. I don't look back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CBA)
I close my eyes and walk slowly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CCA)
I'm not looking ahead, so I'm worried I might bump into someone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CDA)
Wait, am I even walking straight in the first place?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CEA)
【Kurisu】What are you trying to show off for?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E2E)
My shoulder is suddenly pulled from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E3E)
I brace my legs so I don't fall backwards.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE0)
【Rintaro】What are you doing!? You just ruined my production-- a farewell scene walking into the sunset, and you still call yourself my assistant!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EFA)
【Kurisu】Like I said, I'm not your assistant! And besides, I still have something to talk to you about!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F0A)
Dammit, her obstinacy has returned...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F24)
【Kurisu】I didn't hear this, but before, you said I was stabbed, right? I demand an explanation for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F34)
That's right, that's another Phenomenon hasn't been elucidated even though it occurred in real life.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F44)
【Rintaro】That was an illusion I saw.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F54)
I'll just leave it at that for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6E)
【Kurisu】Why did you dream about me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F7E)
【Rintaro】I don't know. And it wasn't a dream, but an illusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F98)
【Kurisu】You said something about Doctor Nakabachi, but what was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FA8)
【Rintaro】On that day, Doctor Nakabachi held a time machine presentation at Radio Kaikan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FB8)
【Kurisu】The presentation was canceled. Because of the satellite crash.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FC8)
【Rintaro】That's how things seem to have turned out, huh. But it safely opened in the illusion I saw. Mayuri and I went to see it when you called out to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FE2)
【Kurisu】I don't flirt. Much less call out to idiots like you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FF2)
【Rintaro】Like I said, it was an illusion, right? No, maybe... it's this world that's the illusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003002)
【Rintaro】If that's the case, that solves the riddle of the Microwave Ophone (Temp). If it's an illusion, then it could possibly disregard the laws of physics.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000301C)
【Kurisu】Escapism? How unexpectedly chicken, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000302C)
【Rintaro】I proposed a hypothesis. That's the strong point of physicists.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003046)
【Kurisu】So, who stabbed me? Don't tell me, you did?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003056)
Back then, I recall the sight of Kurisu collapsed in a puddle of blood and start shivering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003066)
Was that really an illusion? Even so, it was too real.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003076)
I can clearly remember the smell of blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003086)
【Rintaro】When I rushed over, you were already collapsed and bloody. I couldn't find the culprit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003096)
【Kurisu】I don't get it. Why do I have to die in your illusion...? Do you hate me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030A6)
【Rintaro】Not one bit. At that point in time, we had only spoken once. We were just passing strangers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030B6)
Well, that one time we talked was during the events of the illusion, so strictly speaking, at that point in time, the only information I had on the person named Makise Kurisu was that she had been published.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030C6)
【Rintaro】Anyway, we basically had no points of contact. That's why, after seeing your corpse, I ran away without calling 119.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030E0)
【Kurisu】How cruel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030F0)
【Rintaro】What do you want? You want me to go back to the past and handle your corpse courteously? I'd need to use the Microwave Ophone (Temp) for that, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003100)
Though we'd still need to clear the problem of returning to the illusion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000311A)
【Kurisu】...That's enough. Don't see any more illusions. It doesn't feel good to think you're being killed in other people's dreams.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000312A)
【Rintaro】I can't make any guarantees. To do that would require 24 hour perfect surveillance inside my brain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003144)
【Kurisu】You really have a comeback for everything, don't you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003160)
Kurisu shakes her head side to side in amazement as she walks toward the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003170)
Looks like she wants to end the conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003180)
In revenge for last time, I grab Kurisu's delicate shoulder from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032CC)
【Kurisu】Kyah,
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032E6)
 wh-what--!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032FA)
【Rintaro】I'm not done talking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003314)
【Kurisu】You're trying to pick a fight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003324)
【Rintaro】It's revenge for ruining my farewell scene, Christina! You shall regret your thoughtless actions!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000333E)
【Kurisu】Okay, okay, understood. So, what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000334E)
【Rintaro】About the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000335E)
【Kurisu】I don't know what you mean if you just say about. What about it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000336E)
【Rintaro】...No, if you don't know, that's okay. Fare thee well. We'll probably never meet again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033E4)
This time for sure, I turn my back to Kurisu--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003500)
【Kurisu】Don't just stop talking there. That feels bad, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003510)
She grabs my upper arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003520)
Damn woman. Not once, but twice...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035C2)
【Kurisu】What is the IBN five... whatever?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035D2)
【Rintaro】IBN 5100. A retro PC from 1975. I'm searching for it now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035E2)
【Kurisu】Hmmmm. What do you plan to use it for?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035F2)
Looks like she's interested.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003602)
She was the same when she came to the lab too, but it seems like this woman is just brimming with curiosity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003612)
【Rintaro】Interested?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000362C)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000363C)
Kurisu quickly averts her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000364C)
But she doesn't let go of my arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000365C)
【Rintaro】You're interested, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000366C)
【Kurisu】...Just a little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000367C)
【Rintaro】Then allow me to tell you. The IBN 5100 and SERN have a secret connection.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003696)
【Kurisu】SERN as in... that SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036A6)
【Rintaro】Indeed. And through our lab's elevated examination efforts, we have found traces of SERN researching time travel.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B6)
Now, be surprised.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D0)
【Kurisu】...Ridiculous. Never heard of that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036EC)
Kurisu gives me a cold glance, this time for sure letting go and walking away alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036FC)
Fuck-damn-shit-cunnnnt!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000370C)
Just you watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000371C)
I'll definitely disclose SERN's conspiracy!
<FILEEND6S>
