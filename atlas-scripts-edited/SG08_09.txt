【Mayuri】Ah, tutturu-. Welcome homekarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000264)
【Itaru】Die, normalfag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000274)
When I come back to the lab, I'm greeted by Mayuri's smiling face, and Daru's gaze filled with pure anger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000296)
【Itaru】Who would've thought that our pretentious hipster Okarin would get a girlfriend? I'm not even <DICT>jelly</DICT>...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A6)
【Mayuri】How'd your date with Luka-chan go-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B6)
【Rintaro】Well, it was sort of... a Stage Clear, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C6)
I felt it wasn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B6)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, the day after tomorrow is ComiMa, so do you think Luka-chan and Okarin could come as a cosplay couple-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003E1)
【Mayuri】I kinda want Okarin to persuade Luka-chan as her boyfriend-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FE)
【Mayuri】No matter how many times Mayushii asks, she never once said OK. To cosplay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005AC)
【Mayuri】But if lovey-dovey Okarin asks her, then I'm sure she'll say OK-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000650)
【Rintaro】I refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006FE)
【Mayuri】Eh-? Why-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A2)
Because ComiMa is on the 15th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000846)
Mayuri's death is on the night of the 15th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008EA)
Just how would our faces look if we cosplayed at ComiMa on such a day...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098E)
【Rintaro】To be honest, I don't understand at all how dates can be fun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A3C)
【Itaru】Geh!? Okarin, you, those words you said make you the enemy of virgin gentlemen the world over! Apologize! Apologize to the virgins!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE0)
【Rintaro】Just think about it. All you do is fuss over your partner, take a boring walk together, eat, and go home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B84)
【Rintaro】So? What's fun about that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C32)
【Mayuri】...Okarin. If you say that, it'll make Luka-chan sad-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD6)
Mayuri says that with an unusually serious expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7A)
【Mayuri】Just being with the one she likes... is a girl's happiness, you know? That alone is enough, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E28)
【Mayuri】Is it not like that for boys...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECC)
【Mayuri】Then... that makes Mayushii lonely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F70)
I don't really get how that makes Mayuri lonely, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101E)
【Itaru】Okarin's in the minority. Anyway, dates have tons of erotic events.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C2)
【Rintaro】You're a real dunce, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001170)
【Itaru】What are you talking about!? Holding hands and stuff, that's seriously erotic, right? When you're linking arms and her boob hits your elbow, isn't that just too erotic!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121E)
【Itaru】And then at the end of the date, you kiss, right!? Goddammit! You stupid normalfag!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C2)
【Rintaro】You play too much eroge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001370)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey. When did Luka-chan fall in love with Okarin-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001414)
【Rintaro】When? Well...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AA)
【Luka】It really surprised me, but... but back then, when you said "That doesn't matter"... it really made me happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
【Luka】Ever since you said those words...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170E)
【Luka】I've liked you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001810)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B4)
I try remembering again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001958)
Something still feels off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019FC)
Something's strange.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA0)
My words: "That doesn't matter".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B44)
Didn't I say those words with the assumption that Lukako is a guy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE8)
【Rintaro】...Right, that's right. Weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8C)
I finally notice what felt out of place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D30)
In this world line where Lukako is a girl, why would Lukako remember what I said back then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD4)
Then I suddenly remember what happened with Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F64)
【Faris】...I remember nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002024)
【Faris】The wish Faris granted was--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C8)
【Faris】...to revive Papa who died 10 years ago nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021BE)
I see. Faris remembered her memories from before she changed the past, before she sent the D-mail, didn't she?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002262)
Then does that mean that Lukako remembered the past-- before she changed genders?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002306)
That would explain everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023AA)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244E)
She has that memory, yet she said she liked me for it, so then...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F2)
Did Lukako like me even when he was a guy...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025A8)
It looks like I need to confirm this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026FC)
The next morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000270C)
I head to the shrine to meet with Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002754)
Lukako was already in the grounds, waiting. When she sees me, she smiles and waves her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002764)
Mmmm, cruelly cute as always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000277E)
【Luka】Good morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000278E)
【Rintaro】Ahh, yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000279E)
【Luka】Where are we going... today?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027AE)
【Rintaro】More importantly, Lukako.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027BE)
【Luka】Yes?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CE)
I make up my mind and just throw out the question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027DE)
【Rintaro】Do you still have any memories of when you were a guy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027F8)
【Luka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002808)
Lukako twitches for a moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002818)
And then hangs her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002828)
【Luka】N-no, I don't...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002838)
【Rintaro】Really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002848)
I try asking, but Lukako stiffly nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002858)
If I put out a firm attitude, I can make her talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002868)
But the contents of the manual burn inside my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002878)
Doing things that make the girl sad is absolutely no good! You might get dumped!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002888)
If I get dumped, then what will happen to our 4-day lover agreement?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002898)
If it's invalidated, then Lukako might not go back to being a guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028A8)
...No, Lukako's not that sort of jerk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B8)
Mayuri's life hangs in the balance, so I'm sure that no matter what I say, she'll go back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C8)
That way of thinking is kind of naive, isn't it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028D8)
But most importantly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028E8)
Although I'm doing this to save Mayuri, it's not like I can just trample over Lukako's pure maidenly heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028F8)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002912)
【Luka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002922)
Lukako, and I.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002932)
Are unable to weave any words.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002942)
Mutual distrust? Suspicion? Discomfort?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002952)
If I say something--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002962)
If I just say something--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002972)
Our temporary relationship feels like it could break at any moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002982)
A suffocating silence surrounds us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002992)
【Luka】...I'm sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A2)
【Luka】Let's cancel... today's date...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029BE)
Lukako bows her head and goes back into the shrine office.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029CE)
I feel guilty that I hurt her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029DE)
And at the same time, I'm relieved at my unpleasant feelings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B16)
Without returning to the lab, I stand on the bridge in front of the station, blankly watching the stream of people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B26)
Faris might be visiting the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B36)
Because, right after I came to this world line, Faris was at the lab today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B46)
Since my actions shouldn't have influenced Mayuri's, she should've called Faris over to look at her cosplays.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B56)
I don't want to see anybody right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B66)
I suffer alone, on the overpass.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B76)
In the end, no matter how much I use my brain, I can't think of a good idea.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B86)
Lukako said "If we become temporary lovers, then I'm okay with going back to being a guy". I've stayed faithful to that, so--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B96)
Faithful? How?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BA6)
I just made a huge mistake back there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BB6)
I've done nothing but make Lukako sad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC6)
Tomorrow...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BD6)
Tomorrow is the 15th. The same day ComiMa opens; the same day Mayuri dies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE6)
At the very least, I need to make our relationship last until that evening.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BF6)
Tomorrow is the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C06)
But I'm not confident I can give Lukako a fun time as a lover.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C16)
Alright. Instead of fussing over a date, I'll just try something that won't make Lukako sad.
<FILEEND77>
