<END>

The only absolute answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB8)
That entire equation collapsed on itself.
<END>

And instead, what was presented was--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4A)
Abandon Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDE)
Abandon Mayuri?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DFA)
That sort of extreme choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB6)
Radio Kaikan is still off limits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC6)
They still haven't repaired the hole in the eighth floor wall that the satellite-- that Suzuha's time machine had destroyed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED6)
I can look down on Akiba's streets from the rooftop.

From up here, the streets look tight.

Now, above the guardrail in front of me, a yellow train runs through the Sobu Line.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F12)
I wanted to be alone, so I came here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F22)
The day before yesterday, I canceled our plan to crack with the IBN 5100 right after hatching it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F32)
Kurisu and Daru pressured me to tell them why, but I just couldn't explain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4E)
It's already been two days since.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F5E)
I couldn't make a decision when faced with such an extreme choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6E)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7E)
Just what should I do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A2)
Kurisu's mysterious death that day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B2)
On that day, where I'm standing right now, when Doctor Nakabachi presented his would-be time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D2)
July 28.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E2)
Two weeks ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F2)
Let's say, that as planned, we delete the first D-mail I sent-- the one conveying Kurisu's death-- from SERN's database.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001102)
Then I return to the β World Line, where it all began. What would happen then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001158)
My predictions would say that our comrade, Lab Member 004, Makise Kurisu--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001174)
Would disappear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001184)
It's a contradiction for someone who died two weeks ago to be alive in August 15.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001194)
A time paradox.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A4)
Kurisu must not exist in August 15.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B4)
The world has already eliminated her existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011C4)
I have been given two choices.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000121E)
The first choice is to hack SERN with the IBN 5100 and delete the data of the first D-mail I sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000122E)
If we do that to return to the β World Line, Kurisu would disappear, but Mayuri wouldn't die. In the future, the world will be free without SERN creating a dystopia.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001294)
The second choice is to keep living here in the α World Line without hacking SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A4)
Mayuri will most likely die. So will Moeka and FB.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B4)
Kurisu may be forced by SERN to pursue time machine research, but at the very least, she won't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C4)
And then SERN will rule space-time, and complete their dystopia in the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000136C)
【Rintaro】Chose one, huh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137C)
I laugh in self derision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138C)
I could do nothing but laugh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139C)
Such an absurd decision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013AC)
This is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BC)
【Rintaro】This isn't something... I can choose...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013CC)
I don't really care about the future, be it free or ruled by SERN's dystopia.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013DC)
Though I really should care, since Suzuha entrusted her wish to me, I should think this through properly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EC)
But no matter how much I try to think 20 years into the future, I just can't feel a sense of impending doom.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FC)
What's important to me now is Mayuri and Kurisu. Whose life to steal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C0)
If I were given this choice back in July 28.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DC)
I would probably have chosen to abandon Kurisu and save Mayuri without any hesitation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001624)
But those conditions don't really mean anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001634)
It isn't July 28. It's August 15.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016DA)
I spent these past two weeks with Kurisu as a lab mem, and now she's melded perfectly into our lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016EA)
All these times I've time leaped, I've been saved countless times by Kurisu's existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016FA)
She was always calm, always precise, always giving interesting hypotheses, always pushing my back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170A)
The Time Leap Machine wouldn't have even been completed if it weren't for Kurisu. So just the fact that I've reached this point is all thanks to that genius girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171A)
Then how the hell could I just abandon her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178A)
But on the other hand, letting Mayuri die is also out of the question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001830)
I've kept fighting until now for the sake of saving Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001840)
I came prepared to throw away my life if it's for her sake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001850)
I want to save Mayuri more than anyone else.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001860)
I want her to live.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001870)
So I absolutely cannot just sit back and watch her die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001880)
I won't let Mayuri die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F0)
【Rintaro】So in the end, I didn't chose either... there's no way I could chose either...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001900)
In other words, this choice is which do I kill.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191C)
【Rintaro】Is this how... it ends...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A94)
I drive my fist into the wire fence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA4)
【Rintaro】Suzuha, Faris, Lukako, Moeka... I've come all the way here by sacrificing your memories, and this is how it ends...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB4)
Is there no other option?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC4)
A loophole, where neither dies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE0)
...Can't I use Suzuha's time machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF0)
After returning to the β World Line, time travel to July 28 with Suzuha's time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C0C)
No, that's impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C1C)
In the first place, Suzuha leapt to 2010 to change the future of SERN's rule. That cause and effect only happens in the α World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2C)
Once I escape from the α World Line, Suzuha's desired future will be realized, eliminating her reason to leap to 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C3C)
If Suzuha's time machine only exists in the β World Line, I can't use it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4C)
...In that case, what if I send a D-mail to Kurisu that day, warning her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5C)
Warning...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB6)
Something like, "Don't come to Doctor Nakabachi's presentation", for example.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC6)
No, that won't work either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE6)
There's the Attractor Field Theory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF6)
Cause and effect will converge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D06)
No matter what I do in the β World Line, Kurisu will die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D16)
No matter how I try to avoid it, it'll be like how I couldn't save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D26)
Now, here in the α World Line, the world wishes for Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D36)
In the β World Line which I'm struggling to get to, the world wishes for Kurisu's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D46)
【Rintaro】It's no good...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D56)
I slowly sink to the floor with my back to the wire fence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D66)
【Rintaro】I can't... save her...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D76)
I'm powerless against the result the world wishes for...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
What should I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D96)
Just what should I do...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E3E)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4E)
Maybe--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F66)
Maybe Mayuri doesn't die in the current world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F76)
Moeka's mail got canceled. I haven't seen the Divergence Meter in detail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F86)
So the possibility isn't zero is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F96)
Or perhaps, following the flow of things, the deadline of Mayuri's death is the night of the 17th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FA6)
If Mayuri doesn't die that night between 7 and 8--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FB6)
Then there will be no need for me to make this extreme decision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FC6)
From all my experiences so far, I understand it's unlikely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD6)
But even so, I can't help but cling onto that hope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002070)
Mayuri and Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002080)
If I can save both of them,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000209C)
I don't care if the future is ruled by SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020AC)
I can even easily betray the memories Suzuha entrusted to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020BC)
So please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020CC)
Don't wish for Mayuri's death any more...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DC)
Those wishes of mine, those prayers of mine... to whom should I send them to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020EC)
To God?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020FC)
To the World?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A0)
Surely in that case, the tiny prayers of a man like me won't reach--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B0)
I embrace the conviction known as hope within my heart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E8)
This year's summer ComiMa is open three days, from the 15th to the 17th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F8)
That last day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002308)
I go with Mayuri to the event grounds from morning till the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002318)
Though all I did was carry Mayuri's bags.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002328)
It's not really my thing, and the crowd was dreadful, so I just spaced out in the corner. Occasionally, Mayuri and I would go back for food and drink, but otherwise, I spent the day alone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002338)
In some sense, it was escapism. I made my mind a blank, distracting myself from the ominous premonition.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002348)
But even so, I felt the grim reaper's countdown clock ticked down, and couldn't calm myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C4)
【Mayuri】Haa, we're finally home-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D4)
It was already dark when we went home by non-stop shuttle bus.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E4)
In Mayuri's hand is her costume carrying case.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F4)
In my hands are illustrated paper bags. Inside is a large amount of doujinshi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002504)
By the way, it's not what I bought, but what Mayuri bought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002514)
...Maybe this was the reason she didn't participate in cosplay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002524)
After all, buying stuff there is hectic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002534)
We just stand there for a while after getting off the bus.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002544)
【Rintaro】What are you going to do from here? Heading straight home?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000255E)
【Mayuri】No. Actually, I was thinking of going to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000256E)
【Rintaro】Need something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257E)
【Mayuri】Not really, but it's been a while since I've gotten to relax with Okarin- so
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258E)
【Mayuri】I'm a little hungry, so on the way, I'll buy some Juicy Karaage Number One.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259E)
ComiMa, the unusual festival, has ended.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025AE)
I want to experience the everyday after these long three days--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025BE)
That's what I might have thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025CE)
I hold back a groan and shrug.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025DE)
【Rintaro】Well, let's go home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026B2)
【Mayuri】Heyhey, Okarin. Why did you come with Mayushii today-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C2)
【Mayuri】Before now, you haven't come to ComiMa with me, right? Okarin isn't interested in moe, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D2)
【Rintaro】I'm interested in mecha anime.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
But not so much that I'd line up early in the morning each year for ComiMa like Daru or Mayuri though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002702)
【Mayuri】So, why did you come with me today-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002712)
【Rintaro】It was...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002722)
To confirm Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002732)
Those words float through my head, but I desperately shake them out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002742)
Why am I so set on Mayuri dying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002752)
What I should be wishing for instead is that Mayuri doesn't die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002762)
【Mayuri】It was-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002772)
【Rintaro】...On a whim
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000278C)
【Mayuri】I see...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000279C)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027AC)
【Mayuri】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027BC)
We're suddenly visited by silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CC)
Mayuri's face, which is usually smiling, now looks unusually downhearted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027DC)
Did she not like my answer?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027EC)
But it's not like I could just give her the real answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027FC)
I mean, there's no way I can just say
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000280C)
You will die in a few minutes, can I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000281C)
【Rintaro】Lukako...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000282C)
I start making excuses in a panic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002848)
【Rintaro】I thought that I'd see Lukako all embarrassed cosplaying and laugh at him. But unfortunately, he didn't come.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002862)
【Mayuri】Ah, yeah... Even though Luka-kun would absolutely get really popular-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002872)
【Mayuri】His images would get uploaded to all sorts of blogs, he'd appear in newspapers and on news sites, and he'd even get introduced overseas-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002882)
【Mayuri】And then Luka-kun would be a world wide superstar. And then Mayushii would see him and think "Oh, he's gone so far-"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002892)
【Rintaro】It's scary 'cause it's true...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002966)
【Mayuri】...Hey, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002976)
Suddenly, Mayuri turns to me, walking backwards and peeking at my face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002990)
【Mayuri】Thank you for today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A0)
【Rintaro】What's this all of a sudden...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029BA)
【Mayuri】Ehhehe-. Well, I said so before, but this is the first time Okarin came with me to ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029CA)
【Mayuri】It made Mayushii really happy♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029DA)
A smile finally returns to Mayuri's face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F4)
【Mayuri】Ah, but you know, if Okarin cosplays next time, it would make me even happier-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A04)
【Rintaro】...Ahh, I'll think about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A14)
Yeah. Don't think negative thoughts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A24)
Think about a fun, bright future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A3E)
【Mayuri】Eh? It's okay-? Really-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A4E)
【Rintaro】If you participate in cosplay yourself, that is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A5E)
【Rintaro】And not just that, but Lukako too... and invite Christina too. Persuade them to cosplay.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A6E)
【Rintaro】If you can get that far, the I, the star performer, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, will have no choice but to descend upon ComiMa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A7E)
The next ComiMa is in winter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A8E)
And then we'd go there, as if nothing had happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A9E)
We'd all get together with smiling faces. Let's think of that future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB8)
【Mayuri】Oh-kay. Looks like a steep road ahead-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AD2)
【Mayuri】But you know, if I try imagining it, it seems really fun-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AEC)
【Mayuri】And I think Chris-chan has some interest in cosplay too. There is hope-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AFC)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's gonna do her best.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BAE)
We've arrived in front of the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BBE)
I looked up to the second floor window, but there's no light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BCE)
Nobody's here today, unlike usual.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BDE)
I have a bad feeling about this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BEE)
Is Moeka planning an ambush under the cover of night?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BFE)
Although I've forgiven Moeka, Manager, and the Rounders in previous world lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C0E)
Those times have already been undone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C1E)
In this world line, the truth that they're aiming for the Time Leap Machine is left unchanged.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C2E)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, wait here for a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C3E)
Motioning for her to sit and wait on the bench in front, I peek around my surroundings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C4E)
I know this precaution is useless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C5E)
But still, I wanted to do what I could in order to bet on the slight chance Mayuri doesn't die in this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C6E)
It doesn't seem like a good idea to just rush into the lab from the front.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C7E)
I thought I'd first search the circumference of the building for any suspicious figures lurking in the shadows.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C8E)
I part from Mayuri and proceed towards Kuramae Bridge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C9E)
All the while making sure Mayuri doesn't leave my sight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CAE)
I survey my surroundings, looking for any sign of danger--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D36)
【Rintaro】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D52)
Suddenly, the white station wagon parked at the alley engages its engine, and abruptly takes off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D62)
【Rintaro】Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D72)
I can clearly see the driver's seat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D82)
I try to identify the man's face, but nobody immediately comes to mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D92)
At the very least, it's not Manager or Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DA2)
But I do remember seeing that white station wagon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DB2)
In previous world lines, whenever Moeka would try to run us over, it was in this white station wagon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DC2)
When Manager retrieved the IBN 5100, he was in that same car.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DD2)
It's heading my way at full speed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DE2)
I check the place I'm standing at.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF2)
Center of the street. At this rate, I'll be run over to death--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E9A)
The station wagon's headlights switch to high beam.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EAA)
My vision becomes completely enveloped in its light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EBA)
At the same time, my mind turns pure white.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ECA)
My feet freeze at the sudden change of events.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EDA)
This ambush is still an ambush, but instead of inside the lab, it's outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EEA)
And the opponent is a car.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EFA)
What to do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F0A)
What should I do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F1A)
It's okay. I shouldn't die. The world hasn't recognized my death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F2A)
No, wait, what day was it today?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F3A)
Isn't this the first time I've come all the way to the 17th?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F4A)
Meaning, whether or not I die hasn't been decided yet...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F5A)
Will I die in Mayuri's place?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6A)
In that case, maybe I can go in peace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F7A)
No! I don't want to die!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F8A)
Those two contradictory thoughts run through my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F9A)
My body would not react at all contrary to my will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FAA)
Will I be the one to die--?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FBA)
【Mayuri】Okarin!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033BC)
【Rintaro】!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033CC)
My back is pushed forcibly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000373C)
I open my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000374C)
I crawl to the edge of the road.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000375C)
My body is in pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000376C)
But I'm just scratched a bit at most.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000377C)
I was saved--?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000378C)
I raise my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000379C)
What I see is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037AC)
The station wagon's red taillights as it turns at the intersection ahead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037BC)
And then, a little bit away from me-- in the center of the road-- Mayuri's collapsed figure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037CC)
【Rintaro】Mayuri!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037DC)
I rush over to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037EC)
Mayuri is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037FC)
Bleeding, from her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000380C)
Did she protect me...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000381C)
That's, that's just...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003884)
I lift her body up in my arms.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003894)
Mayuri's eyelids twitch and then slowly open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038BE)
【Mayuri】O...kari...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038CE)
【Rintaro】Mayuri... I'm sorry... because of me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038DE)
Her thin hand wanders as if seeking something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038EE)
It's raised towards the starry sky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038FE)
Her eyes look like they'll shut at any moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003920)
But even so, they look straight into mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003930)
For some reason, she's smiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039B6)
【Mayuri】Finally, Mayu...shii... was...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039C6)
【Mayuri】useful... for... Okarin...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039D6)
【Rintaro】What... are you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A46)
Her hand raised to the starry sky grasps at the air.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A5A)
Stardust Shakehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A6A)
Yet in the end, that hand will never hold anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AB2)
It loses strength immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AC2)
I grab the wrist that threatens to fall to the earth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AD2)
Mayuri no longer breathes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AE2)
...How many times have I seen Mayuri die now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AF2)
This time is just... too much...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B02)
This is all my fault, isn't it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B12)
I embrace Mayuri's tattered body, which no longer responds, nor moves at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B22)
I hold back my tears from overflowing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B32)
【Rintaro】Hey, Mayuri...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B42)
【Rintaro】From here, you can't really see the stars too much, can you...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B52)
【Rintaro】This is... too much...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B62)
Why did she have to die here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B72)
What was the meaning of this death?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B82)
The death the world wished for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B92)
Fate that always converges to the same result.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BA2)
I knew it would turn out like this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BB2)
I couldn't avoid Mayuri's death.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BC2)
I knew it from previous experience.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BD2)
But to think I could save her from death...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BE2)
How could she die while smiling...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF2)
【Rintaro】What do you mean "you were finally useful"...? Huh, Mayuri...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C02)
Mayuri has no future in this world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C12)
I can't run away after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C22)
Reach the β World Line by hacking SERN and killing Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C32)
Do nothing and accept Mayuri's death?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C42)
I need to make a decision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C52)
Not anyone else, but the one who has been messing around with the world line as he pleases. Me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E36)
