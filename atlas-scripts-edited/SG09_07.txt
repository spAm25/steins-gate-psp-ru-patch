Not a single soul is seen in midnight Akiba.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000204)
It's so silent, it's eerie.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000214)
Life readings are zero near the usual coin locker, too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000224)
I came here once before with Lukako...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000234)
Just thinking about the size of the IBN 5100 makes it obvious it won't fit in the regular sized lockers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000244)
Basically, that means it could only be in one of the three larger lockers on the right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000298)
【Rintaro】Occupied...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002A8)
The bottom one of the three is occupied.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002B8)
Is the IBN 5100 in here...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002C8)
Of course, I'm excited.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D8)
I've become far apart from you, my destined partner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E8)
You've returned, separated by nothing but a thin locker door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F8)
Is this... what love feels like?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000320)
【Rintaro】...let's not go crazy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000330)
To hold back the rising tension, I think.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000340)
Is the IBN 5100 really what's inside?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000350)
I want to confirm that. I'm glad I got Moeka to tell me she placed the IBN 5100 somewhere in this locker beforehand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000360)
How about I try breaking the bar thingy on the locker door?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000370)
If the IBN 5100 is inside as expected, and I steal it, what would happen to the world line?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000380)
I mean, I can cancel the changes to the past with a D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000390)
I think doing that is a necessary rite to return to the original world line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A0)
But now that the IBN 5100 is this close, it feels like obtaining it's just too easy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B0)
My decision to cancel Moeka's D-mail hasn't changed, but this method's already right before me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C0)
Let's try it, just to make sure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003E8)
And so I go back to the lab, ignoring all the angry complaints and worried voices of the lab mems working overnight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F8)
I then head to the development room, and take out a crowbar-like thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000408)
In our lab's development room lies a heap of objects passed down to us from people all across town-- garbage, basically, so I easily had a crowbar-like thing prepared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000418)
I thrust the pointed tip of the crowbar-like thing into the crack of the locker door, putting in enough strength to force it open--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000047A)
【Rintaro】...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000048A)
Suddenly, a loud siren resounds all around me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000049A)
I look in surprise, and a patrol car's red alarm twinkles as it comes this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004AA)
What bad timing...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000510)
The police release me after about thirty minutes of scolding on the spot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000520)
When I come to the coin locker again and try to wrench it open, another patrol car appears, this time to take me to the police station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000530)
I'm stuck all night getting preached to in the investigation room. This is also the result of attractor field convergence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000540)
No matter what I do or how I do it, the world's really set on me not getting that IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E0)
I get them to call my father, and I'm finally released.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F0)
They didn't go so far as to arrest me, but the police, and my father, scolded me with a harsh tone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000600)
I admirably apologize on the outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006B4)
I part with my father and head straight to Moeka's apartment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006C4)
I called her-- I took the chance to memorize her phone number yesterday-- but she wouldn't pick up at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D4)
I sent a mail to Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E4)
I asked him to check if the coin locker was still occupied.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000784)
The door is unlocked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000794)
Moeka is squatting in the corner as always, hugging her legs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007DC)
【Rintaro】You put the IBN 5100 in the bottom right coin locker, am I right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EC)
【Moeka】...how?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
【Rintaro】There were only three lockers there big enough to fit an IBN 5100, and only the bottom one was in use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
【Rintaro】If you put it in the bottom one, then that means that FB still hasn't picked up the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
【Rintaro】You know what that means?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000864)
Moeka knits her brows.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000874)
【Rintaro】It means that if you stay there, you can meet FB when she comes to pick it up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088E)
【Moeka】...ah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089E)
【Rintaro】You hadn't thought about that? You're a Rounder, yet you lack composure.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AE)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000984)
【Rintaro】I'm gonna try to keep a lookout. You?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099E)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AE)
【Moeka】If you meet... what'll you do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009BE)
【Rintaro】Borrow FB's phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009CE)
That's the best way to prevent Moeka from going to Yanabayashi Shrine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E8)
【Moeka】...I won't meet her. I'm not brave enough to meet her... I'll be disillusioned...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F8)
【Rintaro】Weren't you disillusioned long ago? You were never given any expectations from the start.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A12)
Moeka's face warps again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A22)
My usage of only blunt words was not only because Moeka killed Mayuri, but also because I was getting irritated at Moeka's weakness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B56)
Daru did just like I asked. The locker is still occupied.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B66)
I look around and check to make sure there are no patrol cars.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B76)
This time I won't wrench it open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B86)
They'll definitely arrest me for a third offense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B96)
I hide behind one of Daibiru's humongous pillars across the street, and begin the lookout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CB4)
It's getting tiresome to stand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D60)
I thought of borrowing a handheld game from Mayuri, but there's no point in observation if I'm going to distract myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E04)
But just standing is suffering. And I need to make sure I'm not conspicuous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA8)
If I keep standing in the same place, I might get noticed by surrounding eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F4C)
I'm scared that a security guard might come and scold me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FF0)
And now it's already near 7 o'clock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001094)
My legs have turned into pegs, so I squat and lean against the pillar when it becomes unbearable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001138)
So hungry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DC)
My inner heart murmurs so while I stare at the coin locker nobody comes to use when--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001280)
Somebody taps on my shoulder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001324)
FB!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C8)
I almost jumped in a panic, but my legs felt like they were twisted and couldn't move.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001566)
Moeka hugs her knees and looks at me with cold eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160A)
【Rintaro】Why... are you here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AE)
【Moeka】...I'll keep a lookout too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175C)
【Moeka】Can I...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001800)
【Rintaro】...Why'd you change your mind?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A4)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001948)
I stand up and dust off my clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EC)
【Rintaro】You were comfortable with your "mail-only relationship" with FB. You used to be dependent on that moderate distance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A90)
【Rintaro】So why did you plan to step forward now of all times?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B3E)
【Moeka】...at this rate
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE2)
Moeka puts her head on her knees, with a face still about to cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C86)
I've seen that expression once before, lit by the moon in that apartment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D2A)
【Moeka】...if FB still won't contact me... my connection to the world...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DCE)
【Rintaro】It'll be broken off, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E72)
Moeka faintly nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F16)
【Rintaro】You're so weak that you can't bear loneliness, yet just one word from FB and you'll mercilessly kill someone, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FBA)
【Rintaro】You're just a typical cultist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000205E)
And FB abused this woman's weakness, and finally threw her out like tattered clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002102)
...How frustrating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A6)
FB's vileness. Moeka's weakness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
And then Moeka nervously presents a convenience store bag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F8)
【Rintaro】What's this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000239C)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002440)
Moeka looks down without trying to answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E4)
I try fishing through the contents and--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002588)
【Rintaro】Ohh! Milk cartons and anpan!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000262C)
This stuff is perfect for keeping a lookout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D0)
There's enough for two.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026DB)
【Rintaro】So, do you want to join?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002822)
Moeka nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C6)
【Rintaro】Alright, permission granted. Help me keep a lookout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000297C)
With two of us, we can take turns watching. It also makes us look less suspicious to people passing by.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AB0)
Since it's a lookout, we continue even past nightfall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC0)
We nap in one hour shifts, but I'm still tired and drowsy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AD0)
On top of that, I don't have someone to talk to-- Moeka can't keep a conversation-- so I can't do anything to stave off boredom.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE0)
In the morning, before the sun rose, I went back to the lab to shower, but Kurisu, who was working an all-nighter on the Time Leap Machine improvements, looked at me coldly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C22)
It was past 1PM on the 13th when something changed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CC2)
Someone appeared and opened the lower right locker-- the locker with the IBN 5100 in it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD2)
We immediately move to where we can't be found and peek at the situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D72)
That person was a lackluster middle-aged man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D82)
He was wearing a new suit, but it seemed awfully unnatural.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D92)
It doesn't look like he's used to wearing it at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DDA)
【Rintaro】Is that FB...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DEA)
Moeka strongly shakes her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DFA)
【Moeka】FB is a woman...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E0A)
【Rintaro】So... maybe it's someone hired to pick it up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E1A)
Or it could be the locker's management company, here to retrieve it after its extended neglect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E2A)
In that case, FB, Moeka, and I, are all terribly stupid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E3A)
The man had the locker's key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E4A)
After paying all of the additional fees with 100 yen coins, he takes the cardboard box with the IBN 5100 out of the locker.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E5A)
Thinking ahead, the man brought a push cart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E6A)
After a bit of effort, he puts the IBN 5100 onto the push cart and begins walking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E7A)
【Rintaro】Follow him!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F28)
The man heads straight for Akihabara Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F38)
Strangely, he calls out to a plump man standing in front of the ticket machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F48)
The plump man, wearing a T-shirt, really looks like an otaku. He doesn't seem to have anything in common with the first suited guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F58)
They transfer the IBN 5100's cardboard box onto the plump man's carry-on cart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F68)
They exchange a few words and the plump man enters the station alone while the suited guy sees him off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F78)
【Rintaro】Weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F88)
Is there a point to this transfer?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F98)
Is the plump man FB?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FA8)
The collector handed it off to the deliveryman?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FB8)
At any rate, if we keep chasing the IBN 5100, we'll eventually reach FB.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FC8)
Believing thus, we enter the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030F2)
We take the Yamate Line along with the plump man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003102)
Not in the same car, but peeking from the next one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003112)
It's a weekday afternoon, so there aren't many passengers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003122)
We didn't see the man move for about 30 minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003138)
We arrive at Shinjuku Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003148)
The number of passengers getting on and off instantly multiplies.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003190)
【Moeka】He's getting off...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031A0)
Moeka mutters so while pulling my sleeve.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031B0)
When I look, the plump man had slipped into the stream of departing passengers, and had gone through the door and onto the platform.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000321E)
After getting delayed pushing through the stream of boarding passengers, we get down to the platform.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000323A)
The man is leisurely walking on the platform.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000324A)
The train closes its doors and slowly departs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000325A)
There truly are a lot of people in Shinjuku.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000326A)
We close the distance and follow the man from right behind so we don't lose him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000327A)
Then we're surprised.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000328A)
【Rintaro】Wha...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000329A)
The man is empty-handed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032AA)
The carry-on cart is missing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032BA)
Eh? Why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032CA)
I thought we might have mistaken our man, but that wasn't it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032DA)
We saw him standing still on the train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032EA)
He definitely got off the train onto the platform here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032FA)
I'm certain he had the carry-on cart when the train arrived at Shinjuku.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000330A)
So does that mean that he handed it off to someone in the chaos of boarding and departing people?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000331A)
【Rintaro】Counter-tailing measures... huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000332A)
What a clever ploy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000351A)
TL22.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038E2)
I returned to the lab and time leapt an hour back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F2)
Now I notice what happened on the train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003902)
It's bad manners to take out your phone inside the train, but I have no choice in this emergency.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003912)
Looking at the train's display, it was right about when it left Otsuka, heading towards Ikebukuro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000395A)
Moeka's next to me, hiding her breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000396A)
We peek into the next car, where the plump man stands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000397A)
【Rintaro】It starts at Shinjuku.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000398A)
【Moeka】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000399A)
【Rintaro】That guy's gonna get off, but he actually delivers the package to someone else.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039AA)
【Rintaro】He got us good back then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039C4)
【Moeka】Back then...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039D4)
It looks like Moeka doesn't fully understand yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E4)
【Rintaro】I time leaped from one hour from now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039F4)
【Moeka】...time...leap
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A04)
Moeka's eyes widen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A20)
The train arrives at Shinjuku Station on schedule.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A30)
Just to make sure, I'll have Moeka get off at this station and follow the plump man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A40)
I sneak over to the same car as the plump man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A50)
He still has the carry-on cart with the IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AC6)
【Station Announcer】Shinjuku~, Shinjuku~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AD6)
Passengers spew out of the doors.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AE6)
So does the plump man, just like last time. But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AF6)
【Rintaro】I knew it...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B06)
He leaves the carry-on cart with the IBN 5100 inside the train.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B16)
And now passengers come in from Shinjuku.
<END>

Inside, the one who walks up to the abandoned carry-on cart is a woman in her 30s pushing a baby stroller.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B36)
But there's no baby.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B46)
The woman puts the carry-on cart onto the baby stroller as if it were natural.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B56)
After seeing that with my own eyes, I return to the neighboring car.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B66)
We have to follow carefully.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B76)
This attention to detail isn't normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BCA)
The train starts moving.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BDA)
I contact Moeka so we can regroup later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D02)
After that, the goods swap hands one after the other, transferring around the stations that run through Tokyo like a web.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D12)
Yamate Line, Meguro Station → Nanboku Line, Nagata-cho Station → Yuraku-cho Line, Ikebukuro Station → Fukutoshin Line, Shinjuku-Sanchome Station → Toei Shinjuku Line, Kudanshita → Tozai Line, Kayabacho Station
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D22)
Whenever they gave me the slip, I would time leap and resume the chase.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D32)
And finally, the courier and the goods got aboard the Hibiya Line, and after so many twists and turns, they unexpectedly returned to Akihabara Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD2)
I recognize the last courier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DE2)
He's one of the men involved with Moeka's attack on the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DF2)
Dark skin and a crew cut. The one who first struck me with his gun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E02)
The man easily carried the 25 kilo package out of the station and--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E78)
A car honks its horn.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E88)
Moeka and I immediately hide and peek at the situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E98)
A white station wagon parks in the roundabout in front of the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EA8)
The muscular man who hops out of the driver's seat is--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EB8)
【Rintaro】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F0C)
A familiar face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F1C)
I doubt my own eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F2C)
I reorganize my muddled mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F3C)
That's... Tennouji Yuugo of the Braun Tube Workshop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F4C)
AKA Mister Braun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F5C)
Why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F6C)
Why is he...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F7C)
Does this mean he's involved with FB, and the Rounders?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F8C)
You mean he's been doing shady business in addition to running the completely unprofitable Braun Tube Workshop...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F9C)
I don't understand...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FAC)
I lost all understanding in one go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FBC)
The man who set up shop downstairs from the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FCC)
If he's got connections with the enemy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FDC)
I shiver at the thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FEC)
No, wait, I'm still not sure he has connections.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FFC)
Manager might just be a mere courier.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004018)
Still watching from a distance, we see Manager take the carry-on cart from the crew cut man, and load it into the backseat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004028)
And then he gets into the car alone, taking off towards Showa Dori.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004038)
I couldn't do anything but stare dumbfounded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004228)
TL23.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045F0)
I time leapt back to when we kept a lookout in front of the coin locker.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004600)
The suited man hasn't appeared yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004610)
I explain the current situation to Moeka, and go on ahead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000466A)
After wasting some time at Starbecks, I rent a car at a nearby rental shop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000467A)
Or so I say, but I don't have a license. Moeka's driving.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000468A)
We go to the street in front of the roundabout, heading toward Showa Dori, and park in front of Yodobashi Camera. Now we wait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046D2)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046E2)
【Rintaro】Nervous?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000046F2)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004702)
【Rintaro】You're straining your shoulder too much. How much have you driven before?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004712)
【Moeka】...license.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004722)
【Rintaro】License? You mean you have nothing but a license? Oh come on... just don't crash.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004732)
I was surprised Moeka had a license in the first place, but it seems like FB persuaded her to get one by telling her it's necessary for Rounder work.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000476A)
Moeka's on standby in the car while I watch the roundabout up close.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000477A)
The white station wagon's already stopped there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000478A)
Peeking inside from far away, I can definitely see Manager in the driver's seat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000479A)
Nobody else is riding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047AA)
The crew cut guy should come out right about after 5PM.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047D2)
And just like I remembered, the crew cut guy comes out of the station, easily tugging along the carry-on cart.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047E2)
He walks up to the Manager's white station wagon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047F2)
It feels kind of weird seeing the exact same scene from a different perspective.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004802)
I hurry back into the car where Moeka waits.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004812)
【Rintaro】He's coming!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004822)
The IBN 5100's pickup station wagon zooms past us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004832)
It takes a left turn at the Showa Dori intersection, towards Okachimachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004842)
Moeka smoothly sets the car in motion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048A4)
And the place we arrive at is Manager's house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048B4)
An old one-story house in Okachimachi.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048C4)
The house where Hashida Suzu, where Suzuha, lived.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048D4)
In front of the house was her old rusty MTB, as usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048E4)
Manager brings the IBN 5100 into his house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048F4)
Stopping a little further down the road, we watch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000493C)
【Moeka】What... does this mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000494C)
【Moeka】Where is FB...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000495C)
【Rintaro】The question is why did he bring it into that house. Is it for temporary storage, or could it be--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000496C)
Manager, or someone Manager knows, might be FB...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000497C)
But FB should be a woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000498C)
Meaning Manager's wife-- Tennouji Nae's mother, whom I've never met before, could possibly be FB.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000499C)
As a test, I have Moeka show me one of FB's mails.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A56)
She kept a lot of mails like this one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A70)
【Moeka】M4 is my codname...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A80)
【Moeka】FB... came up with that for me too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004A90)
Moeka's a mailing machine, sending FB nearly 10 mails a day, yet FB wrote replies to each one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AA0)
Normally, that would piss people off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AB0)
With this in consideration, I can understand why Moeka would grow dependent on FB.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AC0)
【Rintaro】This time we're on lookout here, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AD0)
I had Daru prepare an infrared CCD, and set it up wirelessly on the telephone pole in front of Manager's house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004AE0)
We observe in the car parked a little away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C06)
As if nothing had happened, Manager left the next day on his scooter, returning upon nightfall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C16)
We never saw his daughter, Nae, nor his wife I've never seen, take one step outside the house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D4C)
It was the dawning of Sunday before movement began.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D5C)
Just a little before 3 in the morning, people suddenly gathered in front of Manager's house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D6C)
I couldn't quite count since it was dark, but it was around six people.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D7C)
【Rintaro】That's...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004D8C)
I recognize those guys.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004DEE)
They're the Rounder's men who attacked the lab with Moeka in other world lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E42)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E52)
Moeka didn't show much of a reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E62)
They should be acquaintances, so why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E72)
I tried asking, but she said she hasn't seen them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E82)
In this world line, Moeka has been completely removed from the Rounders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E92)
Are they done with her since they got their IBN 5100?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F68)
Manager comes out of his house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F78)
He loads the IBN 5100 into the usual station wagon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F88)
The six men also get into the car.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004F98)
But Manager just sees them off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000506E)
【Moeka】Where to now...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000507E)
I'm interested about Manager's story, but we're chasing the IBN 5100 now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000508E)
These guys will lead us to FB. That's why we chase the station wagon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051B6)
The car was headed to Narita International Airport, of all things.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051C6)
The men go through boarding procedures, bringing the IBN 5100 aboard an airplane headed to France.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051D6)
France.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051E6)
In other words, the country where SERN is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051F6)
Meaning... what...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005206)
【Rintaro】Tennouji's wife might be FB.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005216)
The person I still haven't seen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005226)
I've yet to meet her, so that means she's just that cautious of contact with others.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005236)
When I think about the α World Line, Moeka's gang attacked on the night the Time Leap Machine was completed, as if they had timed it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005246)
It's no mystery when you consider that FB had a strong connection with Manager, whose shop is directly below.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005256)
Since he was feeding her all of our information, it was almost like we were dancing in the palms of FB's hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005266)
Returning to Akiba from Narita, I walk over towards Manager's house.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005276)
But on the way, I got an angry call from Kurisu saying "Tell me what's happening", so I reluctantly had to meet up with her.
