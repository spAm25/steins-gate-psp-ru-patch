A quantum theory approach to explaining the Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment without Einstein's deterministic perspective.<LINE>
It's thought that before the box is opened, the cat's condition is superpositioned between "living" and "dead".<LINE>
The instant the box is opened and observed, the wave function collapses to either condition.<LINE>
If the cat is alive upon opening the box, then the truth retroactively becomes "the cat was alive before the box was opened".<LINE>
Conversely, if the cat is dead, the truth becomes "the cat was dead before the box was opened".<LINE>
On the other hand, through the same quantum theory approach comes another interpretation-- by the many-worlds interpretation, the observer who observed the cat living inside the box, and the observer who observed the cat dead inside the box can be thought of as superpositioned and then diverging.<LINE>
In current quantum theory, this Copenhagen interpretation is the standard school of thought.

That boundary is the event horizon. No information that occurs within an event horizon can be observed from the outside.<LINE>
The center of a black hole is pitch black because no light can escape from it.

For some reason, as one ages, time seems to pass by more quickly.<LINE>
For example, one year is one seventh of a 7 year old's life, while it's only one seventieth of a 70 year old's life.<LINE>
By this reasoning, the subjective length of time is inversely proportional to age.

The most famous paradox in quantum theory.<LINE>
A thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrodinger to repudiate quantum mechanics.<LINE>
But currently, this paradox is being proven to not be a paradox.<LINE>
Instead, it's being used as a widely accepted phenomenon that resembles a paradox in quantum mechanics, and is often referenced.<LINE>
A cat is placed inside a box installed with a poisonous gas release system and radioactive radium.<LINE>
If the radium emits an alpha particle, it sets off a sensor, releasing the poisonous gas and killing the cat.<LINE>
Let's say radium has a 50％ chance of alpha particle emission in one hour.<LINE>
After that hour, the moment one opens the box, the cat has a 1:1 likelihood of being alive or dead.<LINE>
So how was the cat before the box was opened?<LINE>
According to Einstein, even without observation, the cat was either alive or dead.

Experimental equipment that accelerates various charged particles into collision for the purpose of researching the resulting reactions.<LINE>
The type of particle accelerated also determines the naming scheme of the equipment.<LINE>
In recent years, most high energy accelerators have been synchrotrons - ring types.<LINE>
Ring type accelerators require high costs for their large-scale construction, but they can perform the most efficient collision experiments.<LINE>
The reason for the ring shape is because charged particles can be sent through an electromagnetic field to bend their tragectory through the Lorentz force.<LINE>
The main synchrotrons, other than SERN's LHC, are located in the US, the UK, and Japan.

It doesn't feel like a mere illusion, but a very real "past experience" that couldn't be forgotten or mistaken for a dream.<LINE>
However, when and where that "past experience" happened cannot be remembered, resulting in an intense feeling of strangeness.<LINE>
The cause has yet to be explained. ne theory is that it is a physiological phenomenon caused by an anomaly of memory where "recollection" and "previous memory" desynchronize temporarily.<LINE>
The cause is theorized to be convulsion-like spasms in the brain's parahippocampal gyrus, which is in charge of processing space and "familiar" sensations.

Waves that hold properties of both electricity and magnetism, first formally postulated by Maxwell in 1864.<LINE>
The electric field and magnetic field mutually propagate each other, causing space itself to oscillate, becoming a wave as it propagates through its surroundings.<LINE>
This is why it's called electromagnetic radiation.<LINE>
Based on their frequency, EM waves are divided into radio waves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays.<LINE>
On the topic of the negative effects of electromagnetic waves on the human body, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that "research has not been able to provide support for a causal relationship", however, the lack of a relationship has also not been proven.

Afterwards, research continued, and the consumer appliance version was launched in America in 1947. It uses electromagnetic waves at a frequency of 2.45Ghz.<LINE>
Consumer grade output is around 500-1000 watts, and commercial grade output is around 1500-2000 watts.<LINE>
This is a special frequency known as ISM Band, also used by WLAN.

The problem that could have been possibly caused by old computers once the year 2000 would come.<LINE>
In order to save memory space on old computers, years were almost always abbreviated to the final two digits.<LINE>
Because of that, once 1999 changed to 2000, the last two digits would change from 99 to 00.<LINE>
If its programming didn't anticipate that change, the computer could erroneously assume the year was 1900.<LINE>
It was hypothesized that the computers used in the realms of the military, finance, and utilities would malfunction and cause the worst-case scenario.<LINE>
To address this issue, counter-measures were taken in the mid 1990s to manually update every program.<LINE>
As a result of this counter measure, the Year 2000 Problem ended as nothing but needless fear.

(Fictional) A popular internet-themed manga serialized in LocoLoco Comics.<LINE>
The third season of its TV anime series is currently being broadcast on ToTV to rave reviews.<LINE>
It airs every week Sundays at 9AM.<LINE>
On first glance, the series' atmosphere and character design make it appear aimed towards children. However, in actuality, it abandoned fantasy to depict heretofore unseen realistic themes, garnering appreciation from adults and children alike.<LINE>
More and more children are learning information (and misinformation) about the internet through this anime to boast to their friends.<LINE>
Because of this great influence, a portion of the intellectual world has begun to deem children more informed about the internet than adults. A movement has begun to call this generation of children "RaiNet Children".<LINE>
Some politicians and organizations have strongly criticized the series for "encouraging children to become hikikomori" by idealizing boys and girls who cling to computers. However, a large majority of adults appreciated the series' lessons on "the possibilities of the internet, internet morality, copyright infringement, and confidentiality", eventually silencing the opposition.<LINE>
And thus, RaiNet Kakeru grew to become the universally loved series it is today.<LINE>
Although the series stirs intellectual curiosity through entertainment, it is not a simple educational program.<LINE>
The viruses used by hackers, crackers, and cyberterrorists on the show, as well as other internet terminology, are given visual representations. The protagonist also brings out typing techniques to control programs shown on computer monitors as virtual robots.<LINE>
The confrontations are visualized into easy to understand battles, with well-timed perspective changes depicting both the protagonist's techniques inside the computer, and his friends' teamwork outside the computer.

Does not refer to actual teleportation.<LINE>
In 2004, Japanese researchers made their first successful "complete quantum leap experiment".<LINE>
Suppose we have twin particles(photons in this case), A and B. Since they are twins, they have the property of symmetry; if one is spinning face up, the other is spinning face down.<LINE>
Meaning observation of either A or B allows one to know the status of both without observing the other one. This is called entanglement.<LINE>
The state of an elementary particle(photon) cannot be confirmed until observed.<LINE>
Several states overlap; the state is "undetermined" until observation.<LINE>
We can use entanglement, and attach Data C, the information we want to teleport, to Photon A with the observation equipment. By observing this entangled state, that is, "AC", we can be assured that no matter how far away B is, we can decide its state as "BC".<LINE>
(At this point, B has not been observed) Afterwards, once we send Photon AC's information from A's observation equipment to B's observation equipment through traditional transmissions, observing Photon B changes it to "Photon BC".<LINE>
This process is called quantum teleportation because Data C actually teleports. However, since one step requires using traditional information transmission, it is impossible for the information to exceed the speed of light.<LINE>
Finally, Photon BC's "teleported" Data C is actually a copy of Photon AC's Data C. The whereabouts of the original Photon C become unknown.<LINE>
This point differentiates quantum teleportation from actual teleportation.
