【Mayuri?】Hey what are you mumbling about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E2)
No sound is coming from the phone I'm holding against my right ear. A perfect silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F2)
Strong summer sunlight is hitting me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001102)
Sweat is slowly flowing down my chin and dropping onto the asphalt below.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000114A)
【Mayuri?】Okarin? Hey!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000115A)
In front of me stands a girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000116A)
Tilting her head she calls my name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117A)
Her facial expression holds the innocence of a middle school girl. She doesn't understand that we're wading into enemy territory nor does she sense the tension in the air.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001190)
After placing my hand on the mic of my phone I put my index finger on my mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A0)
A gesture asking for silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BA)
【Mayuri?】Are you on the phone with someone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F6)
I nod my head and return the phone to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001206)
The other end of the phone still emits no sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
They probably became silent as our conversation was something that shouldn't be spread lightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001226)
【Rintaro】...No ignore what you just heard. Everything's fine. We'll infiltrate the assembly grounds now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001236)
Same as always the other party is silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001246)
Apparently they're only listening to my progress report.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001256)
A rational decision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001266)
Having a regular conversation here would be too risky and foolish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001276)
【Rintaro】Yes Dr. Nakabachi went off by himself. I'm planning on having him tell us plenty on the subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001296)
【Rintaro】...What!? The "<DICT>Organization</DICT>" has already begun its operations!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A6)
I widen my eyes and exclaim in a shocked manner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EE)
The girl turns towards me in surprise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FE)
Or more like she was already staring at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141A)
While shaking my head and pressing my temple I quickly let out a deep sigh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142A)
【Rintaro】I see so that's the choice of Steins;Gate. El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001440)
Saying the password I bring the phone away from my ears and place it in my breast pocket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001450)
Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001460)
One could call it 'the will of the gods' or perhaps even "fate".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001470)
There are only a few people who know of its existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001480)
Anyways let's go ahead and start the infiltration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001490)
I pick up my feet and move towards the Radio Center by the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CC)
This is an infiltration into enemy territory so I cannot take the risks of mindlessly breaking in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DC)
Ignoring the elevator and escalator I took the stairs towards the 8th floor which is also the topmost.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EC)
However I used up all my strength upon reaching the 7th.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FC)
【Mayuri】Who were you talking with on the phone back there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160C)
The girl who caught up with me Shiina Mayuri asks me that while being perfectly fine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161C)
Due to my loss of energy after going up the stairs I put my hands on my knees and take a deep breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162C)
Apparently using the stairs wasn't a good idea. It's too intense.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163C)
After wiping off the sweat running on my forehead I face Mayuri again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001684)
【Rintaro】Don't ask. It's for your sake as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169E)
【Mayuri】Really? Thank you Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AE)
Mayuri smiles happily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BE)
She truly is very perceptive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CE)
She understands the position I'm in and doesn't meddle any further.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176C)
She is my childhood friend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177C)
A 16 year old female high school student younger than me by 2 years. She's more like a little sister to me rather than a childhood friend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178C)
Our places of residence are in the same neighborhood and we spent a lot of time together since long ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179C)
I once thought that Mayuri has the qualities to be burdened with the cruel fate of being the key to Steins;Gate. Just now the idea came to me again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AC)
I want her to always be by my side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BC)
That's a modest wish that I thought just now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DE)
Upon entering the assembly hall on the 8th floor we're greeted by a cheap-looking set up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EE)
A sign says "Doctor Nakabachi's Time Machine Invention Press Conference".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A36)
【Mayuri】Anyway Okarin Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A46)
She's been calling me that for a while now but that is neither my real name nor my codename. It's a nickname she's given me that even I don't like.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A56)
【Rintaro】Mayuri I keep telling you. Do not call me "Okarin".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A66)
【Mayuri】Eh? But I've been calling you that since a long time ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A76)
【Rintaro】That's all a thing of the past. I am now "Hououin Kyouma". An insane mad scientist targeted by secret organizations from all over the world. Fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A90)
【Mayuri】But I can't remember such a difficult name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA8)
Anyhow Hououin Kyouma is my <DICT>True Name</DICT>
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC2)
【Mayuri】Besides it doesn't resemble "Okabe Rintaro" at all. What a weird name eheheh
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD2)
Hmm she smiles with honest happiness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE2)
By the way Okabe Rintaro is my real name but I don't like it because it sounds stupid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF2)
And due to that I dislike the nickname "Okarin" which was taken from my real name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B02)
Anyway "Okarin"? Seriously?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
That sounds like one of those yellow buckets they have in bathhouses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2C)
【Mayuri】So Okarin. Uhmm can you tell me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B3C)
Looks like she doesn't understand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B4C)
She's been calling me that for 5 years now so now I'm halfway towards giving up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B5C)
【Mayuri】What's gonna happen here from now on?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6C)
【Rintaro】You're saying that you accompanied me without even knowing that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B86)
【Mayuri】Yep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
She smiles while nodding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
This is Tokyo the Radio Center in Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
The 8th floor here is an event space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC6)
【Rintaro】What will begin here is Doctor Nakabachi's press conference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD6)
Doctor Nakabachi is an inventor. A famous person who often appears on TV and holds some patents. Though the world in general sees him as nothing more than a lunatic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF0)
【Mayuri】A press conference? But I don't see any reporters...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C00)
It's just like Mayuri says.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C1C)
I took a glimpse into the inner part of the assembly hall but I didn't see neither cameramen nor people that look like reporters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2C)
Including me there are about 10 men idling around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C3C)
Yes just 10.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4C)
Considering Nakabachi's popularity and that this is event touches the subject of "successful development of a time machine" there should've been much more people here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5C)
【Rintaro】This is probably a disturbance caused by the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C6C)
Muttering with self-derision I make a forced reaction and strain my lips.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7C)
Nakabachi is not my acquaintance but he's a person who was on the same side as me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8C)
However he resigned and left us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C9C)
The Organization couldn't overlook this timing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CAC)
【Rintaro】I really don't want to get involved with this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CBC)
Nonetheless I'm very interested in what he has to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CCC)
That is the reason why I came here wasting an early afternoon of my precious summer holiday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CDC)
After thinking about what I just mumbled to myself Mayuri tilts her head after a lengthy pause.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D28)
【Mayuri】Evolved?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D42)
Ah that reminds me frill-necked lizards look like they evolved from dinosaurs don’t they-. Ehheheh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D56)
I let out a sigh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D66)
Laughing at her own silly retort... What nonchalance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D76)
Well but she was always like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
【Rintaro】Be careful Mayuri. It's possible that something might happ-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E28)
Right when I was saying that!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E40)
What is this sound? <DICT>Electromagnetic wave</DICT> attack?!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FCA)
The floor is slightly shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FDA)
Definitely an attack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FEA)
From above.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FFA)
However the 8th floor that we're on is the topmost.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200A)
If it's from above then it can only be the roof.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002052)
【Mayuri】An earthquake? Shindo scale 2? Magnitude 2? What was the difference between Shindo and magnitudes again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000206E)
I leave the troubled girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000207E)
Feeling something bad I rush out of the assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002194)
Disregarding the sign that says "no entry" I run to the staircase which leads to the rooftop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002490)
For some reason the door to the rooftop is open or more like the lock is broken.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A0)
Just as I open the door I see lots of black smoke rising up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B0)
Moreover for some reason the air is filled with rainbow colored phosphorescent light dancing around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C0)
【Rintaro】An... explosion!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D0)
I try to fake surprise but wait is this seriously an explosion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E0)
This is bad my chest is starting to throb.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F0)
My heart is beating faster.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002500)
Uhmm... W-what course of action should I take?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002510)
Should I run away?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002520)
But why an explosion? Terrorism?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002530)
I don't really think that's it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002540)
Why? Because there's a strange object placed in the very middle of the empty space of the rooftop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C2)
【Rintaro】What... Is this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D2)
It's a mysterious piece of machinery.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E2)
Considerably large. About 3 meters or more in height.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F2)
Is this a... space satellite?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002602)
Is this the cause of all the shaking and the matter flying around?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002612)
Who would put such a thing here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002622)
Was this thing prepared by Nakabachi? Does it have something to do with the presentation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002632)
Even if hypothetically speaking this was true then how would he get this thing up here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002642)
This is the rooftop of an 8 floor building.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002652)
My head is full of questions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002662)
Obviously I will not find the answers by asking myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002672)
While I'm hesitating on whether I should come closer to the mysterious object the staff of the Radio building and the press conference start to come here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002682)
Everyone is as bewildered as I am.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002692)
【Woman】Please do not come closer!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A2)
And so one of the women who I think is one of the staff starts to approach us while waving both of her hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026B2)
【Woman】The press conference will begin as scheduled so please wait for it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C2)
Is she trying to hide something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D2)
The situation was dealt with awfully quickly and I was kept away from the object that looks like a satellite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
【Rintaro】This smell. It's the smell of a conspiracy. What are they trying to hide? What was the explosion about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F2)
I mumbled and tried to arrange my thoughts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002702)
It's bothering me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002712)
It's bothering me but I should really try to avoid danger for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002722)
It's not like I got scared or anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028A4)
Led by the officials I return to the 8th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B4)
Mayuri wasn't in the event assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C4)
After a short search I found her in the hall of the 7th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029EA)
Under a plate which says "The Land of Japan's PC Origin" <DICT>Capsule Toys</DICT> were lined up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029FA)
She's gazing at them with a greedy look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A24)
While feeling great relief I take out my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A34)
【Rintaro】It's me. I have a bad feeling about this. I think that something might be happening in places we don't know about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A44)
【Rintaro】Yes I understand. I won't do anything irrational. I too value my own life. El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A54)
After saying the password once again I wipe my forehead with the back of my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A64)
This sucks. So much cold sweat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A74)
What should I do if something is actually happening?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A84)
My feelings are split between excitement and anxiety.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A9A)
I put away my phone and return my gaze towards Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B08)
What is she doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B18)
Could she be daydreaming about capsule toys?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B28)
She doesn't seem to be perturbed by the explosion at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B38)
I can't decide if that's amazing or just idiotic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B48)
【Rintaro】Mayuri what are you up to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B9C)
【Mayuri】Hmm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BB6)
【Mayuri】Well... I really want an Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC6)
Just like I thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C90)
On the capsule toy machine that Mayuri pointed at there was a cheap display saying "RaiNet Kakeru 3D Character Doll Series".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA8)
Among children and adults alike there's not a single person who doesn't know the anime "<DICT>RaiNet Kakeru</DICT>"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CB8)
A card game based on it "RaiNet Access Battlers" even gained popularity overseas to the extent of there being world tournaments held.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CC8)
By the way the Upa that Mayuri mentioned is an extremely popular RaiNet character which is something along the lines of a mascot to the series.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD8)
It's appearance is that of an egg with little limbs attached to it due to which it vaguely resembles a dog.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE8)
This thing seems to have the role of the weak mascot character.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF8)
It's not strange for it to gain popularity among high school girls. This reminds me of some ugly frog character which was popular last year. I forgotten it's name though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D50)
【Rintaro】Go ahead and try it. Though it's not guaranteed that you will get an Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D60)
However Mayuri has a troubled smile on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D7A)
【Mayuri】But Mayushii is completely out of 100 yen coins.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D8A)
Mayuri calls herself "Mayushii".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D9A)
To be precise after "Mayushii" a ☆ needs to be added.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DAA)
Therefore it's "Mayushii☆".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DBA)
Though that's completely pointless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DCA)
【Mayuri】That's why Okarin Okarin can you lend me 100 yen?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DDA)
As if demanding something she shows me the palm of her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DEA)
Apparently she was expecting this from the very beginning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DFA)
At least she didn't say "Hand it over" or something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E0A)
【Rintaro】Don't act like a spoiled brat Mayuri. I will not lend you money. Right now I will teach you how harsh life can be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E6A)
After declaring that I take out a 100 yen coin from my wallet and insert it into the slot. Then I forcefully turn the lever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE0)
【Mayuri】Ah ahh-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F08)
I open the capsule and take out the contents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F50)
Mayuri was trying to sneak a peek at what I am holding interested about what was inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6A)
【Mayuri】Ah It's an Upa. And it's metal. A Metal Upa!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F7A)
【Rintaro】Is it rare?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F8A)
【Mayuri】Very!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FF8)
While examining the Metal Upa we get away from the capsule toy machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003008)
A boy who seems like an elementary school student was watching us so he ran up to the "RaiNet" machine to try his luck.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003018)
【Boy】Ah a normal 'Upa'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003028)
With resentment he glares at the Metal Upa that I got.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003038)
Mayuri is standing next to me with her eyes shining.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003048)
Hey high school girl you're on the same level as an elementary school boy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030AC)
【Rintaro】Hah well then I shall give this to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030BC)
To be honest I don't care at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030CC)
I force the Metal Upa into her hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030DC)
【Mayuri】Really? Is it okay Okarin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030EC)
【Rintaro】I am Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030FC)
【Mayuri】Eheheh thank you Okarin♪.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000310C)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000311C)
Could it be that she's ignoring me on purpose?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000314A)
【Chairman】
To those who have gathered here today to attend Doctor Nakabachi's Time Machine Invention Press Conference we give our honest thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000315A)
A dim microphone voice that came from the floor above said that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000316A)
【Rintaro】Looks like it's beginning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003224)
I go towards the 8th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003234)
However Mayuri doesn't follow me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032A2)
【Rintaro】Come on Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032EA)
【Mayuri】Uh-huh wait wait. I have to write my name on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032FA)
Looks like she's engrossed with the Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000341E)
【Chairman】
Well then without further delay I introduce to you the inventor Doctor Nakabachi! Everyone please welcome him with a round of applause!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003494)
Greeted by the clapping of only a few people Doctor Nakabachi appears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034A4)
He's walking towards the platform in the inner part of the press conference room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034B4)
He has a sour look on his face. Displeasure seems to be flowing all over his body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003562)
【Nakabachi】I am Doctor Nakabachi. Pleased to meet you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000357C)
【Nakabachi】Okay then to those who have gathered here I will teach the theory behind the invention of the century that will surely stay in human history - a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036A6)
【Mayuri】Time machine? Did that person make one?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B6)
Mayuri caught up after finishing writing her name on the Metal Upa and asks such an obvious thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D2)
With a microphone in one hand Nakabachi brimming with confidence starts talking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E2)
With me included the audience is about 20 people. More than there was before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F2)
But as expected reporters and cameramen were nowhere in sight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003702)
I now understand how Doctor Nakabachi is treated by society.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003712)
If this lunatic says something like "I've invented a time machine!" they're just gonna sarcastically laugh and say "What is this guy talking about"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003722)
I too came here because I had some interest in what he has to say but it's not like I expect a lot from him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003732)
And after listening to some of his time machine theory I was filled with disappointment which turned into anger in a short amount of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037EC)
【Rintaro】DOOOOOCCTOOOOORRRRR!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037FC)
Disregarding the fact that this is a press conference I loudly shout out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000380C)
【Rintaro】There's a limit to how much you can make a fool out of us!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003826)
【Nakabachi】Who are you!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003836)
【Rintaro】It doesn't matter who I am! The more important thing is the time machine theory that you just recited!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384E)
【Rintaro】Everything that you just said is copied from <DICT>John Titor</DICT>! How dare you call yourself an inventor!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000385E)
【Nakabachi】S-somebody get rid of this man!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000386E)
【Rintaro】You're the one who should get out Doctor! Have you no shame!? You do not have the right to call yourself an inventor!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000387E)
【Nakabachi】Be silent you annoyance! You conceited brat!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000399A)
And so someone behind me grabs my arm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039AA)
Being quite sure that it's an official who came to take me away I forcefully turn around and glare at the person.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039BA)
【Rintaro】Let go of m... hm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A24)
【Kurisu?】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A34)
It's a female about the same age as I.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A44)
She's giving me an intense gaze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A54)
With such a strong look which knows no bashfulness aimed right at me I falter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A64)
I remember this face. Did I see her somewhere before?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A74)
【Rintaro】Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A84)
It's Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A94)
I didn't meet her before but I know her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AA4)
A few days ago my friend Daru aka Hashida Itaru showed me a magazine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AB4)
Inside there was an article which said "Girl Genius Gives a Lecture in Akihabara".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AC4)
This year being only 17 she skipped several grades and graduated from an American university. Moreover, her research was published in an American magazine called "SCIENCE".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B36)
In the article she was introduced as Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B46)
The person in the photo that was inserted there looked exactly like the conceited woman in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C22)
Just like she did in the photo right now she has a sullen look on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D60)
Why would such a genius call out to me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D70)
【Kurisu】Can you come with me for a moment?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D80)
She asks me that while quickly looking around with a stern expression on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D90)
What's with this behavior?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DA0)
She doesn't seem like part of the staff of the assembly hall...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DB0)
Let alone an official of the Doctor Nakabachi's conference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DC0)
Wait... Could it be...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD0)
【Rintaro】Y you a member of the Organization!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DEA)
【Kurisu】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DFA)
【Rintaro】Kuh for them to go that far... I misjudged them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E1A)
【Kurisu】Do not mess around and come with me for a moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E2A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E3A)
For now I'll just shut up and listen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E4A)
Just now due to picking a fight with Doctor Nakabachi I attracted too much attention.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E5A)
Especially Nakabachi himself who is now giving me the most terrifying scowl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E6A)
For him it must be mortifying to be ratted out by a youngster like me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E7A)
Anyway for now I have to get rid of the unnecessary attention I have drawn to myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E8A)
I am an insane mad scientist chased by the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E9A)
If I keep this up, I feel that it might turn into a dangerous situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EAA)
I must not involve Mayuri or any other bystanders in this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EC6)
Makise Kurisu leads me out of the assembly hall while I obediently follow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004070)
【Rintaro】If you plan on doing something to me here then people will know. That's bad for you as well right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004080)
【Kurisu】What are you talking about? Try to act civilized.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004090)
She glares at me with considerable intensity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040A0)
Even if her face holds many graceful features she does not have a shred of loveliness.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B0)
A beautiful agent unmatched in cruelty...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C0)
I sense some trouble but for some reason I felt exhilarated by it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D0)
Looks like chaos gets my blood flowing kukuku.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040EA)
【Kurisu】I only want to ask you something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040FA)
【Rintaro】I do not have to answer that. I know how you people of the Organization work.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004114)
【Kurisu】What is this "Organization"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000413E)
I ignore that question and after quickly taking it out I put my phone against my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000414E)
【Rintaro】It's me. An agent of the Organization has captured me... Yeah it's Makise Kurisu be vary of her... No I'm fine I should be able to get away from her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004168)
【Kurisu】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000424E)
Suddenly Kurisu took the phone from my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000425E)
What a magnificent and speedy surprise attack! I didn't even have time to resist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000426E)
【Rintaro】Guh... what are you doing!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000428E)
【Kurisu】Huh? This phone is off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000429E)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042B8)
【Kurisu】Who were you talking to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042D4)
Being looked at with a questioning glance I quickly turn away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042E4)
Oh... she's good at this. An attack on the mind to make me lose my sense of identity?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042F4)
Reorganize yourself. I will not give in to an attack of such degree.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004304)
【Rintaro】You don't have the right to have that question answered but I'll tell you anyway. That is a special phone which turns itself off if anyone besides me touches it. Fwahahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000434C)
The reason I carry such a phone is to protect all the classified information.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000435C)
I quickly take back my phone and wipe the cold sweat off my forehead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000436C)
Ah that was close.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000437C)
【Kurisu】...Oh so you were talking to yourself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000438C)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000439C)
This is bad. Ordinary methods don't work on girl genius Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043AC)
My mental state is being shaken!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043BC)
Hm looks like it's time to do a strategic retreat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043CC)
I must wait for a chance...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000441C)
Kurisu's expression stiffens and she suddenly draws near me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000442C)
From point-blank range she is glaring straight at me with those large fiery pupils.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000443C)
The light in her eyes is overflowing with a powerful will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000444C)
Without noticing it I am completely charmed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000445C)
Could the owner of such honest and pure eyes actually be an agent of the Organization...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004478)
【Kurisu】A while ago what were you trying to tell me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004488)
A while ago?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004498)
【Rintaro】When exactly do you mean by "a while ago"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044A8)
【Kurisu】About 15 minutes back. Before the conference began.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044B8)
What is she saying? This is the first time I've ever met her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044C8)
15 minutes ago I was messing around with Mayuri and her Upa capsule toys.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044E2)
【Kurisu】You tried to tell me something right? With a look on your face that was overflowing with sorrow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044F2)
Is this a trap? Because this certainly looks like foul play by the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004502)
However why would this girl use such methods?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004512)
【Kurisu】You looked like you were about to break down crying and like you were in a lot of pain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004522)
【Kurisu】...Why? Did we meet somewhere before?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004532)
Makise Kurisu doesn't look like she's joking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004542)
However I do not know this woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004552)
Wait don't get fooled by her face!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004562)
She's an agent unmatched in cruelty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004572)
If I show her an opening it's my loss...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000458C)
【Kurisu】Anyway why do you know my name?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000459C)
【Rintaro】I can see through everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045AC)
Because I'm a mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045BC)
【Rintaro】Genius girl when we meet next time we're gonna be enemies!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045CC)
【Kurisu】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045DC)
【Rintaro】Farewell... fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045FE)
I do a 180 degree U-turn and gallantly run down the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000460E)
Makise Kurisu's words telling me to stop catch up with me but there's no way I'm listening to the words of the enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000473A)
【Rintaro】D... damn you Organization! Sending in agents... Looks like they're finally getting serious
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000474A)
I hurriedly ran down to the 4th floor and looked behind me. After confirming that Makise Kurisu didn't follow me I put my finger on my temple and take a deep breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000475A)
【Rintaro】S... still I cannot let them capture me at this point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000476A)
Okay then what course of action should I take?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000477A)
At first my aim was to listen to Doctor Nakabachi's conference but now I know that it's a rip-off so there's no point in going back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000478A)
I should just return home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000479A)
That seems to be the best choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047F4)
Wait I just realized that I'm forgetting something important.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004804)
Now what exactly is it...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004824)
【Rintaro】Crap I left Mayuri behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004834)
What a dead weight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004844)
I shouldn't have brought her here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004854)
Even though I thought of her safety first and foremost I let down my guard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004864)
For now let's try to call her. If possible I'll just tell her to get over here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048B0)
While thinking that I take out my phone and turn it on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048DA)
Just when I did that the phone rang.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004922)
【Rintaro】Hm? A mail huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049A4)
It's not a normal mail but a movie mail with a video attached.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049B4)
I don't recognize the sender's email address.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049E4)
With a sense of suspicion I play the video.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004BFA)
【Rintaro】...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C0A)
It's nothing but static noise and snow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C1A)
A prank? Or perhaps an attack by Makise Kurisu? Is this some mysterious sound wave that makes people go crazy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C2A)
...No I don't remember giving her my mail address so I'm probably thinking too deep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C3A)
After feeling stupid due to obediently watching some of the video I click my tongue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C4A)
Seriously I don't have time for something this pointless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004DD8)
After stopping the playback of the movie mail I look through the address book and call Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E08)
【Rintaro】Guh Mayuri. Why aren't you answering?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E18)
If it's come to this looks like I'll have to go back to the assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E28)
However if I meet Makise Kurisu again there might be some trouble.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E44)
【Rintaro】Huh!? Could it be that Makise Kurisu kidnapped Mayuri!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E54)
【Rintaro】Damn you. Is that how the Organization does things?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E64)
I do not have the alternative of leaving Mayuri behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E74)
This is overprotective of me but I cannot have her leave my sight. She's like a little sister to me and there's the danger that she might wander off somewhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E84)
And by "somewhere" I mean "somewhere that's not here".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E94)
She was like that since forever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004EA4)
...Perhaps me becoming Hououin Kyouma is one of the reasons for Mayuri being in danger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004EB4)
【Rintaro】Looks like I have to return.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004EFA)
I wearily start going up the stairs towards the 8th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005026)
When I returned to the assembly hall Doctor Nakabachi's conference was just about to end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005036)
There's no one on the platform. Apparently the fake inventor already left.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005046)
The 20 or so attendees one by one started their leaving preparations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000505C)
I find Mayuri instantly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000506C)
In the corner of the assembly hall she's restlessly looking around for something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000507C)
Looks like she wasn't kidnapped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000508C)
I don't see Makise Kurisu anywhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000509C)
This is truly convenient.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050AC)
【Rintaro】Kukuku... that woman got cold feet and ran.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050BC)
【Rintaro】Fine. I will let you go this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050CC)
While cautiously looking around I run up to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005120)
【Rintaro】Mayuri why didn't you answer the call? It's time to take our leave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005130)
【Mayuri】Ah Okarin. My Metal Upa ran away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005140)
Completely downhearted she complains to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005150)
【Rintaro】Ran away? So it moved on it's own volition. That's some real fantasy right there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005160)
【Mayuri】I dropped it somewhere...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005170)
I get it. So now she's looking for it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005180)
Truly a trivial thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005190)
【Rintaro】If you don't see it then give up. We'll just get another one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051A0)
【Mayuri】We won't get another one. You know Metal Upa go for 10000yen in internet auctions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051B0)
【Rintaro】W...what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051C0)
For such a measly toy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051D0)
【Rintaro】Mayuri where did you drop it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051EA)
【Mayuri】I don't know that's why I'm looking... Anyway if we find it we're not selling it okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051FA)
【Rintaro】Fwahaha... that 10000yen will go to my research funds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000520A)
【Mayuri】I'm telling you we're not selling it. I even wrote my name on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005226)
So with my eyes wide open I start the search for the Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005236)
【Mayuri】Tutturu~♪ Mr Upa Mr Upa please come out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005246)
Even if Mayuri calls out to it like that there's no chance that it will come out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005256)
By the way "Tutturu~♪"" is a phrase that Mayuri likes. She uses it in many situations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005266)
Though I still don't know the meaning of it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005276)
We can't find the Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005286)
This might mean that she didn't drop it here but in the hall near the capsule toys on the 7th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005296)
It's possible that someone picked up the Metal Upa and while knowing it's price they took it to sell it later.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052A6)
Imagining that I writhe in frustration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052B6)
【Rintaro】Damn you you vulgar beast who thinks of nothing but money. Have some shame...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052FE)
【Mayuri】You too Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000530E)
Guh I've just been retorted by Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005344)
【Rintaro?】AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005354)
【Rintaro】!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005364)
What was that voice just now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053AC)
【Mayuri】A... scream?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053BC)
This isn't normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053CC)
I am easily able to count the amount of people remaining in the assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053DC)
Most of those who came to see the conference already left. Including me and Mayuri only about half are remaining.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053EC)
Everyone who heard the scream are cowering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053FC)
I don't think I'm acting any different.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000540C)
You don't hear such a hair-raising and aberrant scream everyday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000541C)
Again...? Is this the continuation of the explosion? Something is really happening again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000546C)
Mayuri tightly grasps my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000547C)
【Rintaro】Mayuri stay here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000548C)
I take a deep breath gulp down my saliva and start running towards the direction where the scream came from.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055F0)
Not towards the stairs but just a bit deeper down the hallway. It's dark and gloomy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005600)
I think I heard the voice come from here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005610)
Lowering my back I carefully walk forwards while looking around and being discrete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005620)
After I turned a corner 'THAT' entered my field of vision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005630)
In the middle of the hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005640)
Something is collapsed with it's face on the ground.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005650)
Someone is collapsed with their face on the ground.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005660)
I can't move an inch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005670)
I remember that attire.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005680)
What is that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005690)
Who is that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056A0)
I instantly recognize it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000595A)
【Rintaro】M...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000596A)
Makise Kurisu...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000597A)
I can't see her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000598A)
But there's no mistaking it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000599A)
She's the conceited girl genius who messed with me just about 10 minutes ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059AA)
Lying in a puddle of vivid crimson blood she lies there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059BA)
She's dead...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059CA)
【Rintaro】Eh... w... why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059DA)
I realized that I'm shaking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059EA)
What to do? I want to run. I want to run away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059FA)
I shouldn't have come here to see this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A0A)
This is obviously abnormal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A1A)
Not ordinary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A2A)
I can only see that someone has killed Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A3A)
Who?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A4A)
There are no other people here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A60)
【Chairman】uh... aahhhh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AD8)
Startled I turn around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AE8)
A few other men caught up with me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AF8)
Completely pale everyone is looking at Kurisu's dead body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B14)
【Chairman】Call the police!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B24)
The one who shouted that with a shaky voice was the man who hosted the conference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B34)
As if waiting for those words everyone start screaming and run away simultaneously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B44)
I of course am one of them for there is absolutely no reason for me to stay here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B54)
I feel bad for Makise Kurisu but emotions like "I want to run away" and "I'm afraid" win over that feeling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005BDA)
I return to the assembly hall and Mayuri was waiting there with a face that is about to cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C22)
【Mayuri】Okarin... what's wrong...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C72)
【Rintaro】W... we're getting out!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C82)
I drag Mayuri's hand and we leave that place as quick as possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DE6)
As we are running down the stairs I try to remove the image of Kurisu's corpse from my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DF6)
However it's impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E90)
What's burned into my eyes might not be her corpse but the vivid crimson blood spreading out under it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005EA0)
This was the first time I've ever seen a dead body of a person.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005EB0)
Happily I never had to witness the death of a relative.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005EC0)
I never even attended a funeral.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FD8)
This was the first time I saw a dead body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FE8)
Chills run through my spine when I remember the fear or more like the disgust I felt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000060FE)
I can't think of anything else.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000610E)
No other thoughts come to my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000611E)
Even though my relation with Makise Kurisu was only that one meeting...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000629E)
【Rintaro】Haa... haa...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000062AE)
Once I reach the Central Street I stop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000062BE)
After running down the stairs at full speed I am completely out of breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006306)
【Mayuri】Hey... hey... what happened? You're completely pale...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006316)
Mayuri has a nonchalant expression on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006326)
Obviously because she didn't see that scene.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006336)
She's also perfectly fine after running so much.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006346)
Even though she's thickheaded she sure has a lot of stamina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006356)
【Rintaro】A person... died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006370)
【Mayuri】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000638C)
I take many deep breaths.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000639C)
The color of the blood is still floating around in my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063AC)
Regardless of that I'm now partially calm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063BC)
Makise Kurisu was killed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063CC)
I don't know the culprit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006442)
I can already hear the sirens of the ambulance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006452)
After that the police will get involved and this place will be in an uproar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006462)
Right now however the hundreds of people walking around Akihabara do not know about this event.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006472)
Everyone is walking around as always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006482)
Looking for electronics, moe or ero.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006492)
The usual Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000064BC)
I for some reason take out my phone from my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000064CC)
It's not like I'm planning on using it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000064DC)
Oh right! I'll report this event to Daru who told me about Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065BC)
This is truly imprudent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065CC)
Blood is flowing straight into my head and I'm getting agitated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065DC)
After that event I'm not able to make sound decisions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065EC)
Humans are only human after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065FC)
We're not perfect beings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000660C)
Yes I understand. After all...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000661C)
We're just something that comes out from a dirty piece of meat in the form of some ooze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000662C)
And by being nurtured in a womb we gain free will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000663C)
That's all a human is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000664C)
Burdened by a slight amount of sentimentality I start inputting words into the phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000066EA)
"Someone stabbed Makise Kurisu. Don't know what guy did it, though. Looked bad. Hope she's okay."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000066FA)
I don't know the criminal's gender but for no reason I think that a guy seems more realistic. It's just a guess though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000670A)
While I'm at it I'm not even sure if she was stabbed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000671A)
I only think that since there was no sound of a shot and that there was a large puddle of blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000672A)
However I didn't write that she was "killed".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000673A)
I don't know why and I can't find the reason for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000674A)
I think it's because I "decided" to write it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000675A)
For some reason I feel kinda guilty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000676A)
It's not like I'm the one who killed her. While thinking about my current mental state I put on a wry smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000677A)
Just a while ago I saw a human's dead body right in front of me and now just a few minutes later I am laughing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000678A)
Am I really such a cruel and coldhearted human being?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000679A)
Quite fitting a devilish insane mad scientist such as myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067AA)
Drawing my finger closer to the "Send" button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067BA)
I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067CA)
Slowly
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067DA)
Press it
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067F8)
I have sent the mail--

Right after that--

#WRITE(PTR, $00006C48)
What was this feeling just now...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006C58)
Wait more importantly...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006D7A)
【Rintaro】Gone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006D8A)
Summer holidays.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006D9A)
Noon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DAA)
Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DBA)
Central Street 1 minute walk away from the station.

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DCA)
Right here--

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DDA)
In nothing but a moment--

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DEA)
Thousands of pedestrians--

Inside my field of vision--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E0A)
All at once--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E1A)
Vanished.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E2A)
Is this a dream? Am I seeing an illusion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E3A)
I don't get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E4A)
But they're gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E5A)
I saw that very moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E9A)
I just silently enter a state of terror.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006EAA)
In a completely empty Akihabara...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006EBA)
all alone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006ECA)
I'm standing here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006EDA)
Consumed by confusion I unintentionally look up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006F70)
The Radio building--
