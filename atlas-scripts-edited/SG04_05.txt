When I get back to the lab, Moeka's squatting at the staircase to the second floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000051C)
Since she's not sitting on the bench, I guess there really is a jinx that crouching while holding your knees is the best position for a woman.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000052C)
She's staring at her phone like usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000057C)
Once she notices me approaching, she slowly stands up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000058C)
But she doesn't turn her glance this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A6)
【Moeka】...Thank you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B6)
【Rintaro】For what?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D0)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E6)
【Rintaro】I don't really think you're selfish. Rather, I'm the one who should be thankful for your request.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F6)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
Once we enter the lab, I talk to all the lab mems doing their own thing about Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084E)
【Mayuri】I think it's good-♪ Moeka-san is a lab mem after all, right-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000868)
Daru and Kurisu, like Mayuri, don't object either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000878)
【Itaru】So, what sorta mail does Kiryuu-shi plan to send?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000888)
【Rintaro】My request is that its contents be simple, easy to understand, and that we can confirm whether or not the past changes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A2)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000944)
And, a mail came.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AA8)
Why does she have to explain every little thing with a mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABE)
No, More importantly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACE)
【Rintaro】A secret? What do you mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AE8)
【Kurisu】What? What happened?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF8)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C08)
【Rintaro】No, there's no such problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C58)
Kurisu peeks at my phone from beside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C68)
【Kurisu】Hmmm, I see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7E)
【Kurisu】I don't understand how you feel, but since this is strictly an experiment, data collection should take priority.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8E)
【Rintaro】Hoooohhh... We agree for once, Assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CA8)
【Kurisu】I-it's not like I'm agreeing with you. If we don't collect data, then no matter how much time passes, we won't figure out the structure of the Microwave Ophone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D26)
【Mayuri】But, but. You know, girls have tons of secrets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D40)
【Mayuri】It's the same as when you keep unspeakable secrets to yourself and say gehehe-, you know-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D88)
【Itaru】Kwahh!? Don't tell me this is turning into sexual harassment!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D98)
【Rintaro】Calm down, Daru!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF4)
I turn to Mayuri and Moeka, founders of the mainstream girl alliance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E04)
【Rintaro】I don't remember forcing you to write deeply private matters in the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E4C)
Kurisu nods deeply to my words. Looks like she doesn't intend to join the mainstream girl alliance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E72)
【Kurisu】Even if you want to send private content, we shouldn't for now. We haven't completely settled the problems of time paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E82)
【Moeka】...Private content is no good?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E92)
【Kurisu】At least, nothing you want to keep undisclosed. Because, even if you mean well, the mail's contents might have a serious effect on the time axis.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA2)
【Kurisu】You should show your mail to a third party and have them check if the contents are problematic or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB2)
【Rintaro】Mmhmm, Assistant said everything I wanted to say. And, with that said, we have no intention of halting the experiment!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECC)
【Kurisu】...It's not like I spoke for you. Don't misunderstand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDC)
She sure is cheeky to be emphasizing every single point.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF6)
【Kurisu】In the first place, experiments prioritize data over privacy. If you're going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F06)
Don't tell me she's doesn't want to send a D-mail because she's not prepared for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F20)
【Mayuri】Ehh-? Really-? Mayushii just sent a mail without being prepared for that-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F3A)
【Mayuri】I'm sorry-, Chris-chan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F54)
【Kurisu】You don't have to apologize... I'm not criticizing you. That's just the general rule.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F64)
I don't think I've heard of that general rule, but it looks like she'll snap at me if I say anything, so I'll stop for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F8C)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F9C)
Moeka's expression doesn't change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FAC)
Same as always. I don't know what she's thinking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FBC)
【Rintaro】You're already a lab mem. You must have confidence in us. Save private information for another day.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCC)
【Rintaro】If you say you can't, then... I'll be forced to show you. That which lies dormant in me, Hououin Kyouma: the power of ominous insanity...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
Moeka's so concentrated on typing a mail, it doesn't seem like she heard my threat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001102)
【Rintaro】Hmm, umm, it'll be in the arrival history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000111C)
【Moeka】...And the send history?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000112C)
【Rintaro】Nothing, wait, that's not quite it. It'll disappear from the send history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000113C)
I confirmed that after I sent that D-mail yesterday. Moeka should've been there, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001156)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129E)
Looks like she understands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012AE)
I show the mail to Kurisu too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001304)
【Mayuri】Moeka-san, don't overdo it, okay-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001314)
Consolation? Encouragement?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001324)
I don't know her intention, but Mayuri worriedly calls out to Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000136C)
【Itaru】So then, whattaya sending? It's a pretty high hurdle to meet Okarin's request of changing the past in a simple to understand way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137C)
【Rintaro】What are you saying? Isn't it just that all of your levels are too low?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001396)
【Moeka】I have an idea.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013A6)
Moeka murmurs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B6)
【Rintaro】Hohh? Just as expected. Please, give us the details.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D0)
Then, Moeka invokes her special ability again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E0)
High-speed dexterity. The manifestation of Shining Finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F0)
【Rintaro】Shining Finger sure is skilled, huh! A true model lab mem!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001500)
With this idea, it should be simple enough to tell whether the past changed or not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001548)
Looks like these useless three have no objections to the superior masseuse's idea.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000159E)
We look at Moeka's phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F0)
It's purple and gaudy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001608)
There's no strap, and it's not a <DICT>deco phone</DICT> popular among mainstream girls lately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001650)
【Itaru】Oh, that's the GG01 that just came out last month.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001698)
【Mayuri】Gee Gee Zero One?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016B2)
【Itaru】The latest model. I'm pretty sure the LCD is detachable, so you can choose various attachments for it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016C2)
【Itaru】Right now, it's in short supply, so you'd be put on a waiting list wherever you go. You really did well to get one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016D2)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E2)
If she's really that uninterested in the latest popular model,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F2)
Then that means 24-hour phone users are picky about even popular models.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170E)
【Rintaro】So, Masseuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001728)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, why do you call Moeka-san 'misuse'-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001738)
【Rintaro】...That's the name I dubbed Kiryuu Moeka's special ability. Kiryuu Moeka, from here on, you shall call yourself the Flash Masseuse, or in other words, Shining Finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001752)
【Moeka】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001762)
Moeka expressionlessly shakes her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
【Rintaro】What...? You don't like it? I named your special ability, so what are you displeased with...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178C)
【Mayuri】It's cause Moeka-san is Moeka-san. And she's not a masseuse, she works at an editorial company....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A6)
【Itaru】Mayu-shi, it's uncool to seriously reply to trolls.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017B6)
【Rintaro】I'm not trolling, just naming her ability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001806)
【Kurisu】Cut the chatter and just start preparations.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001816)
Gh, dammit. You're just an assistant. Don't boss us around...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000187E)
【Itaru】What if Manager Braun says something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000188E)
【Rintaro】Fuhahaha! Don't be afraid of Mister Braun! If he storms in yelling, I'll kick him to the curb!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000189E)
【Itaru】Seriously? Okarin, you're so cool. That's why I admire you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AE)
【Kurisu】He's just talk, isn't he?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BE)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CE)
I dare not object.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018DE)
Moeka's already finished writing her 36 byte mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018EE)
When I check Moeka's expression to see if her preparations are OK, she faintly nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018FE)
We set the timer to 100 seconds. With this, we should be able to send it to Moeka's phone just about four days back-- to July 31st.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190E)
【Rintaro】Microwave Ophone (Temp), activate!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC4)
About 15 seconds after operation, the discharge phenomenon breaks out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD4)
I signal to Moeka with my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BE4)
Unlike usual, Moeka tightens her expression,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF4)
and presses the send button on her grasped phone--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C88)
