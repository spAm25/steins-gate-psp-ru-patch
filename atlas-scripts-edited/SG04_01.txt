In that case, we have no choice but to find out the structure of the world ourselves. And to do that, we need to experiment.

According to Titor, I have a special ability-- that is, "Reading Steiner".

【Kurisu】You of course. You're the operation's tactician, after all.

【Kurisu】If the subject himself were to write about his impressions during the experiment, that would be even better.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F6)
Kurisu says so as she shifts her glance to Daru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021A6)
【Rintaro】...Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
【Kurisu】Did you just completely forget what happened this afternoon? I'm opposed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F8)
【Rintaro】But when the experiment started, you were enthused. You went along without a single complaint.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000239C)
【Kurisu】Don't fire off delusions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002440)

【Kurisu】Don't correct yourself like that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002636)
【Rintaro】We already performed one experiment. I changed the past myself.

【Itaru】Wah, Okarin, you can't steal a march on us!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027B6)
【Rintaro】I didn't. As a result of changing the past, you all lost your memories of 'before' the change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002864)
【Itaru】...You talking about this afternoon? You suddenly asked about the LOTO SIX.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002908)
【Rintaro】Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A04)
I talk to them about the circumstances of the afternoon experiment.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C8C)
【Itaru】...Seriously?

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D30)
After looking at my face, Daru seems to understand I'm not joking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DD4)
On the other hand, Kurisu's got a sour look. But she's always like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DE4)
Why did everyone else lose their memories? Actually, -did- everyone else lose their memories?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF4)
I want them to experiment too to find out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EA2)
【Itaru】Hwa, OK! I know what I want to change about the past no matter what-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F46)
Daru's really good at adapting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FEA)
He no longer doubts my word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000308E)
...or actually, maybe he's just faithful to his carnal desires.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003132)
【Rintaro】What? You going to tell yourself to go on a diet last year?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031E0)
【Itaru】I wouldn't go on a diet even if I got a mail like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032D6)
Daru told me he wanted to change the events of the "Faris Cup" held at "MayQueen+Nyan⑯" a few days ago. On that day, Daru got insta-killed by Faris in a RaiNet Access Battlers match.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033CC)
【Rintaro】You're gonna overturn the result?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000347E)
【Itaru】I almost completely remember Faris-tan's strategy, so I'll get behind her and attack.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003498)
Hwa, aren't I a genius?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003540)
But with Faris' level of skill, I think she'll get behind Daru behind her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035E4)
【Rintaro】Whatever. Daru, prepare to D-mail!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003692)
【Itaru】Alright, I'll give it my all-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003748)
Daru hunches over and starts typing out the mail.

#WRITE(PTR, $000037C6)
To set up the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s forwarding, I sit in front of the X68000 and take a look at my watch.

#WRITE(PTR, $000037E6)
It's impossible to tell whether or not the Microwave Ophone (Temp) will operate or not.

#WRITE(PTR, $000037F6)
We haven't formed a clear line between the times yet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000383E)
【Kurisu】So what do you think? About memory continuation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384E)
【Rintaro】You're annoying. So your Zombie nickname isn't just for show?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000385E)
【Kurisu】I don't understand what you mean.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000386E)
【Rintaro】Zombies attack people even when they're dead. It's really annoying.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003888)
【Kurisu】Cut the jokes. I'm serious here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003898)
Kurisu's face is scarier than usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038A8)
I might've wet myself a little.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038B8)
【Rintaro】I think that the D-mail's destination is the key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038C8)
【Rintaro】In other words, the person who receives the mail from the future. Only that person is free from the influence of past alteration... I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038E2)
【Kurisu】Hmmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F2)
Actually, that condition doesn't work. If that hypothesis were true, then that wouldn't explain the mass disappearance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003902)
But I don't have evidence that that incident is related to D-mails either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003912)
We can't say anything for sure unless we actually try.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003922)
【Rintaro】Once Daru's experiment's over, I'll have you send the next D-mail. Think about what you want to write.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003932)
【Kurisu】No.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003942)
Kurisu replied emphatically.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003952)
【Kurisu】I won't send one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003962)
【Rintaro】Scared?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003972)
【Kurisu】That's not it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003982)
【Rintaro】Then, are you worried about time paradoxes?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003992)
【Kurisu】Well, there's that, but if I had to say, then it's my personal policy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039A2)
Policy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039BC)
【Kurisu】It just feels like changing the past is cowardly to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039CC)
【Kurisu】I may have only accumulated 18 years of life experience, but I still don't want to change those memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039DC)
【Rintaro】I see. You're content with how perfect you are now, so you don't want to change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039F6)
【Kurisu】How did you come up with that...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A06)
【Kurisu】I don't want to deny who I've been so far. Because even all of my failures are a part of who I am today.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A16)
【Rintaro】Even if we settled all of the Microwave Ophone (Temp)'s problems, you wouldn't use it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A26)
【Rintaro】Even if John Titor said you could use his time machine however you wished, to whenever you wished, you wouldn't use it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A36)
【Rintaro】Even if a blue cat-type robot were to come out of your desk, you wouldn't use it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A46)
Kurisu strongly affirms my questions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A60)
【Kurisu】I wouldn't use them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A70)
【Rintaro】But you love experiments. Don't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8A)
【Kurisu】I-is it wrong to love them?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A9E)
【Rintaro】So basically, you place yourself as the highest observer and look down upon others as test subjects while you chuckle to yourself. Mm, you are truly a mad scientist!
<END>

On the other hand, sure enough, the D-mail was still in the received history. The reception time was two days ago, just like we wanted.

【Itaru】Why!? Okarin changed it, right!?

【Kurisu】Couldn't it be because the "way to win" you sent wasn't surefire? Like, maybe it only gave an advantage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000054AE)
That's what I thought too.

I've heard that Faris has considerable skill.

Daru's underhanded trick through time may not have been enough.

【Kurisu】You really want to win that badly?

At any rate, I don't understand the mail's contents, so I can't verify.

We operate the Microwave Ophone (Temp) through the same process.

We all have our guard up, but the discharge phenomenon doesn't occur.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000569C)
Even though it normally happens about 10 to 20 seconds after pushing the warm button.

In the end, the timer runs out uneventfully.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000575A)
【Kurisu】...Out of time?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000576A)
【Rintaro】Looks like it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005784)
【Itaru】What? And I even wrote out such glorious advice...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005794)
【Rintaro】It's unavoidable. We'll defer the experiment to tomorrow.

#WRITE(PTR, $000057B0)
When I check the clock, it's past 7PM.

#WRITE(PTR, $000057C0)
Looks like the 7's the reference time.

【Kurisu】Yesterday, I was thinking ever since I got back to the hotel. Just what mechanism does this Microwave Ophone use to make time displacement possible?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005818)
【Rintaro】It works similar to the LHC. Didn't you say the LHC was a giant microwave?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005832)
【Kurisu】If a microwave had the same functijons as the LHC, then Japan would become "a black hole for every household".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005842)
【Itaru】Th-that's on Japan sinking level, isn't it-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000585C)
【Kurisu】It looks like SERN creates Kerr black holes all too easily, so it's just mind-numbing, but--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000586C)
【Kurisu】Black holes aren't something that can be artificially created in the first place, and they've got too outrageous risks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005886)
【Kurisu】How can you even think a household microwave could create black holes?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005896)
Titor's time machine is small enough to fit in a car, and it makes black holes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058A6)
He said that, but now that I'm a little skeptic of Titor, I don't say anything in the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058B6)
【Kurisu】What I will say, is that a simple microwave can't create black holes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058C6)
【Kurisu】
I'm certain that some source of interference is injecting electrons into this microwave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058D6)
Some source injecting electrons...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000058E6)
Just what could that be...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005900)
【Kurisu】Well, I'm going back. No need for me to stay in such a filthy man den.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000591A)
【Kurisu】See you tomorrow. Put that report together, okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005946)
Kurisu flings off the lab coat as she hurries out the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005956)
...She was serious about the report?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000599E)
【Itaru】Hmm... Makise-shi's lab coat, huh... Lemme see...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059EE)
As Daru reaches for the lab coat to smell the lingering fragrance, I grab him by the neck and pull down hard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059FE)
【Rintaro】"Lemme see" my ass, stupid! If you have enough time to waste, then go think about how to change the past for tomorrow's experiment!
