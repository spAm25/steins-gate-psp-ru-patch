【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000212)
Slowly being pulled into vertigo, I let out a long breath from the back of my throat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000232)
Alright, world. Show your transfigured self before me...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000242)
I say that, but in the end, I don't know what sort of mail Faris sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000252)
I'm still at Faris' home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000262)
I'm standing by the window. If I look down, an expansive view of Akiba greets me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000272)
I look around the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C2)
【Itaru】Alright then, Card Open.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003DC)
【Mayuri】Awawa-, another Virus Card?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003F6)
【Faris】You're still too nyaive♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000410)
【Mayuri】Hawww... You took three Link Cards, right? And we took three Virus Cards, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000042A)
【Mayuri】Mayushii's driven into a corner...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C8)
What are these guys doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004D8)
The three of them are sitting around a table, taking turns moving things placed on top.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000546)
【Itaru】We still have a Terminal Card. We can seriously turn the tables next turn.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000560)
【Faris】Nyahuhu~♪ It's way too late for a reversal now nya. Faris is going to use the Terminal Card, "Virus Checker" now, nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000057A)
【Faris】So, which card is Mayushii's last Virus Card nya~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000644)
【Mayuri】Auwww~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F2)
【Itaru】Fascinating, Faris-tan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007A0)
【Mayuri】H-hey, could you wait one... no, two or three turns nya-? Can nyu-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084E)
【Faris】Nyaha♪ Not even if you mimic Faris nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008FC)
【Mayuri】No way-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AA)
Mayuri puts her fingers to both her eyes as if to mime tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4E)
Anyway, it looks like they're playing RaiNet Access Battlers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AF2)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C36)
I'm the only one in the world whose memories continue before and after the D-mail was sent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDA)
Reading Steiner unquestionably activated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7E)
So basically, Faris' D-mail caused the world to change.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E22)
In that case, the reason why the three of them are now nonchalantly playing a card game, despite being on guard an instant ago, is also due to the past changing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC6)
And then the fact that Faris sent a D-mail disappeared...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6A)
Most likely, even if I took a look at Faris' phone, the corresponding D-mail won't be in her sent mail history.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100E)
Even if I interrupt her card game and demand Faris tell me what sort of mail she sent, she couldn't answer. Because the very fact that she sent it had become undone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B2)
The only trace would be in the recipient's phone-- namely, Faris' father's phone 10 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001156)
But that 10 year old mail data was most likely erased long ago. So I don't think we can check.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011FA)
Therefore, I can only find out the world's changes myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129E)
Now, let's begin the search for differences--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B2)
【Mayuri】Hawhoo~ Faris-chan really is strong, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D4)
【Faris】Mayushii started out great too nya. You have the potential nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E4)
【Faris】But there's no way the defending champion can lose in a field game nyan!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FE)
【Faris】I also promised to Papa that I'd win this tournament nya! I won't lose to anyone until that day nyan!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001418)
【Mayuri】Papa?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001428)
Faris nods happily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001446)
【Faris】Papa said that if Faris won, he'd absolutely make time off work to congratulate me nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001460)
【Itaru】I want to congratulate you at full force too, but are you open that night?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000147A)
【Faris】That night, Papa and I are eating alone nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001494)
【Itaru】Oh, I see...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014AE)
【Mayuri】You know, for the finals, everyone at the lab should come cheer-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C8)
【Faris】Thank nyu-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E2)
【Itaru】Isn't your final opponent the "Viral Attackers" duo?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F2)
【Itaru】They've been under the radar, and yet they defeated Faris-tan's rivals, "Idiyona".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150C)
【Itaru】Each of Faris-tan and Idiyona's duels are god tier, so I was looking forward to it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001526)
【Faris】I haven't seen any other RaiNetter matches, but are the Viral Attackers really that strong nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001540)
【Itaru】Well, they're not a threat to Faris-tan. Faris-tan is the strongest. Faris-tan is god!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000155A)
【Faris】Nyaww~n♪ It's embarrassing to praise me that much nya~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161A)
Listening to their conversation gives me an indescribable bad feeling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CC)
<LINE>
<LINE>
<LINE>
%LCSOMETHING IS STRANGE.
<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016FC)
An voice whispers from deep within, deeper than reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170C)
After ruminating on the current conversation, I soon realize the meaning of my discomfort.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171C)
Faris shouldn't have gone to any official RaiNet Access Battlers tournaments so far.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172C)
And yet she's about to compete in the -tournament finals-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173C)
Which means she's won matches up to the semifinals.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000174C)
So does that mean Faris' change to the past was so that she could go to RaiNet tournaments?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000175C)
Considering her recipient was her father, maybe he was strict and originally prohibited her from going to tournaments...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176C)
I see. That seems possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177C)
But is that something sending a D-mail can change?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178C)
Faris is still 17 years old, so even if she participates in tournaments now, it's not late at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179C)
If there were an age limit to RaiNet tournaments, it would be a different story...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185C)
Or maybe it's just that everyone has their own morals?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F4)
At that moment, someone knocks on the door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF0)
The door opens halfway and an aging man appears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B94)
It's not that real butler.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C38)
【Faris' Dad】Excuse me. Rumiho, do you have a minute?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CDC)
【Faris】Ah, Papa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC6)
Faris quickly gets up and leaves the room.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F30)
【Itaru】Gwah, Faris-tan's father... Shouldn't we greet him?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200C)
【Mayuri】Faris-chan's dad is a company president, right-? Amazing-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C2)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002112)
Faris soon returns.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002122)
Then she turns to us, apologetically putting her hands together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002132)
【Faris】Apawlogies! Faris has to go out with Papa nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000214C)
【Mayuri】Well then-, this is bye bye for us, then-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002166)
【Itaru】Ehh-? Faris-tan, what about my match? Didn't you promise you'd lecture me about RaiNet in detail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002180)
【Faris】I don't think anyone promised that, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000219A)
【Itaru】Ehh, yeah you did...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021B4)
【Mayuri】Daru-kun, you shouldn't trouble Faris-chan like that-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021CE)
【Mayuri】Come on, Okarin, let's go home-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DE)
【Rintaro】Yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021F8)
【Faris】Now that you mention it, Kyouma's been quiet nya. What's wrong nyan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002208)
【Rintaro】Nothing. I was just satisfied with looking down on Akiba from above.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000222A)
【Itaru】That's Okarin for you... Ambiguous...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000234A)
We go with Faris to the entryway, and her dad and the butler see us off. Her dandy dad tells us to come visit again.
