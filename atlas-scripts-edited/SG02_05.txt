<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F4)
20 minutes have passed since Daru began hacking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000804)
Daybreak. A refreshing summer morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000814)
I peek at Daru's condition while browsing @channel on my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000824)
His typing speed has already become that of a piston.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000834)
His feet move up and down in an accompaniment with the rattatattat of his keyboard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000844)
He hasn't slept in about 40 hours, but Daru still won't separate from his computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000854)
I wanted to ask him if he'd like a break, but hesitated. His entire body exuded an aura that said Don't talk to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086C)
I curl myself up a bit and look back down on my phone screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087C)
The discussions with John Titor don't quite fit together.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088C)
It looks like not even Titor himself knows about the Titor of ten years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089C)
It's hard to imagine that everyone on @channel except me is conspiring.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AC)
But isn't that just baffling?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DE)
So with that said, I do as Titor requested and start to mail him directly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008EE)
He audaciously exposed his own address on @channel. I guess this means he's accepted their challenge!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D6)
In the mail, I question the differences in his posts from 10 years ago and now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E6)
He doesn't seem to be in contact with the Titor who posted 10 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009F6)
I only vaguely remember it, but it went primarily like this:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A94)
・ 2015, World War III breaks out, many people die.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B32)
・ In 2036, the world is contaminated from nuclear warfare
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BD0)
・ He time traveled from 2036 to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100. Its purpose was to revive technology lost in World War III.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6E)
・ The IBN 5100 has a hidden function. The ability to debug IBN's special proprietary computer language before APL and BASIC.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
・ But the only ones who know that fact are certain IBN engineers, so this function does not appear in the manual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAA)
・ In 1998, Titor met his young self and his parents from his early life in America.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E48)
・ Titor aspired to be a time traveler as a soldier.&
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE6)
・ Titor is an American.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F84)
Furthermore, several future events that Titor posted about in 2000 came true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F94)
The Peruvian coast earthquake in 2001, the election of a new pope, the outbreak of the Iraq War, China's advances in space, and so forth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA4)
Though he talked about all of them vaguely, they all came true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB4)
On the other hand, others failed to come true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FCC)
For example, the <DICT>Year 2000 Problem</DICT>, civil war in America, the cancellation of the Beijing Olympics, the inauguration of the America's first female president in 2009, and so forth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
There are others, but let's leave them aside for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
Let's ask him why those predictions didn't come true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011DC)
Alright, now let's send it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001274)
If he doesn't answer honestly, then the current Titor who descended onto @channel is an imposter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001284)
This is your litmus test, John Titor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001294)
Heheheh, now, what color will you yield?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130A)
【Mayuri】Tutturu-♪ Good morning
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B8)
Mayuri comes in.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C8)
She's smiling now, as if she had been cleared of her resentment over her food yesterday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013D8)
【Rintaro】What are you doing here this early?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F2)
【Mayuri】Well, I heard you guys had stayed up two nights in a row, so I brought you provisions-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001402)
【Rintaro】I see. Thanks for your troubles.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001412)
To be accurate, I took a nap yesterday, so it wasn't two nights in a row, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014E6)
Mayuri starts fishing through her convenience store bag.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014F6)
And then she takes out--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001518)
【Mayuri】Tada-h. <DICT>Canned oden</DICT>!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001528)
The canned oden is still warm when she gives it to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001538)
Right away, I open the lid and eat the beef.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001548)
Since Mayuri and I have been together for a long time, she knows what I like.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001558)
I like beef in my oden the best.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001568)
【Mayuri】It's a present from Mayushii-. They're 270 yen each, so savor it, okay-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001578)
【Rintaro】Lately, I've been getting tired of eating bananas and karaage. Please include this in your provisions from now on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001592)
【Mayuri】But Mayushii doesn't have enough pocket money to be that extravagant all the time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015AC)
【Mayuri】Also, Mayushii loves bananas and karaage, so she'll keep buying them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BC)
Mmgh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CC)
The complaint "You'll get fat if you only eat frozen foods" came to mind, but I dare not say it since it's not very effective against Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DC)
She has the metabolism to not get fat no matter how much she eats.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015F6)
【Mayuri】And, there's more. Here, tada~h♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163E)
What she takes out next is a small box with a RaiNet illustration.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000164E)
【Mayuri】RaiNet sausage. You know it comes with an Upa bottle cap as an added bonus-. I really wanted it, so I bought it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000166A)
She sticks out her tongue with an 'eheh'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000167A)
Let's try to make a prediction. In a few months, this lab will be filled with Upa goods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000168A)
It all started with that cushion siting on the sofa, but the number is sure to go through exponential growth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001740)
【Mayuri】So, how's Daru-kun~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E4)
【Rintaro】In the midst of a hard fight. He should at least rest a little. I mean, I never said he ha to do it all at once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
【Mayuri】Daru-kun's supah hakah spirit is burning up ablaze, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192C)
【Itaru】Over there, don't say hakah!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D0)
An empty diet cola bottle comes flying with a whistle.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D20)
It hits my head with a thunk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DC4)
【Mayuri】He sure is tense-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F2C)
Mayuri and I evacuate to a corner of the lounge and quietly eat the oden.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FD0)
【Mayuri】But- hacking is bad, isn't it-? Mayushii doesn't want you to do bad things like that-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002074)
【Rintaro】Letting Daru's supah hakah... I mean, hacker skill go to waste is like throwing pearls before swine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002118)
By the way, it seems like SERN's system got hijacked by hackers in 2008 too. When we searched online, we got news hits talking about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021BC)
Basically, that means that even the people who developed the world wide web have security holes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002260)
With Daru's level of skill, he should have no trouble to penetrate such a security hole.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002304)
【Rintaro】Besides, this is to disclose the wrongdoings of SERN. This is the war against the huge darkness that rules the world from behind!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B2)
【Mayuri】Bad things are bad-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002456)
Mm? Unlike usual, Mayuri seriously believes what I said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024FA)
Well, I know we're doing a bad thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000259E)
But while that may be true, there's no way we can stop now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002654)
I need to change the subject.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000266C)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, want to trade my sweet potatos for your beef?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000268A)
【Mayuri】Ehh-?
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A4)
 In that case, I'd rather have your quail egg-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026B8)
【Rintaro】Don't be ridiculous. After beef, I like quail eggs the best.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D2)
【Mayuri】Mayushii likes quail eggs too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
【Rintaro】Settle for my chikuwa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002700)
【Mayuri】Mm-, okay-.
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000271A)
 Chikuwa's better than sweet potatoes-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000272E)
With that said, I skewer the chikuwa and put in Mayuri's can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000273E)
In return, I take out her beef.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000274E)
And now the subject change is complete. Mayuri really eats up conversations about food. It's so easy to lead her on. Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002751)
【Itaru】Soon... If I can just get the SQL table, I'll have more than enough passwords... gweheheh... don't underestimate me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027CC)
Daru starts mumbling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027DC)
Looks like things are slowly settling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000027F0)
Daru's really is a supah hakah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002800)
It feels like this is the first time I've seen him serious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002810)
Daru bends himself forward, staring holes into the screen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002820)
But all that's on the screen is the same string of numbers and letters...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002830)
【Itaru】Ohoh, gotitgotitgot it-, good, good, yes, prepare yourself. Everything is exposed before me. How does it feel to be naked? Hyahha-, ha, haha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002840)
His eyes are completely bloodshot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002850)
And he's muttering some creepy monologue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002860)
Maybe he's got some strange enthusiasm from lack of sleep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002870)
Daru opens up a new window, types in a 12 letter word(?), and slams down the enter key.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288C)
An error sound rings.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000289C)
Then he quickly deletes the string and enters in a new one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B8)
He keeps repeating that action and then--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000291E)
【Itaru】...Ohh, got it! Got it-----! Matching ID and password! Login complete, fuck yeah! Die! Don't underestimate me! YESYESYES!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000292E)
H-how enthusiastic of him...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000293E)
【Rintaro】Daru, did you get it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A8)
That smug bastard turns around at my voice, with a shining, refreshed face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C0)
As if he had gone into <DICT>le petite mort</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D0)
【Itaru】Mission Complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E0)
【Rintaro】Really!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A28)
【Mayuri】Wah-, that's amazing-. Don't know what that is, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A38)
After 20 hours of agony, it's finally over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A48)
To show Daru my appreciation, I hurl an unopened oden can at him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A98)
【Itaru】An oden can after a job well done is the best.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AA8)
【Rintaro】Good job. You really are the world's best supah haka--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AC2)
【Itaru】Hacker.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AD2)
【Rintaro】H-hacker. I'm glad you're not my enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AE2)
【Rintaro】So, did you find evidence on the world destruction project?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AFC)
【Itaru】No, nothing yet-. I only connected.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B0C)
【Itaru】Well, it's all downhill from here, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B1C)
【Rintaro】In that case, I'm sorry if you're tired, but please get check up on it at once. It's got to be in there. Shadows of conspiracy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B36)
【Itaru】Yeah, yeah, I'll do it. But before that, let me eat the oden can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C5A)
After a short meal break, Daru taps on his keyboard more nimbly than before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA2)
【Itaru】The problem is the who this password belongs to, and their position in SERN, huh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CEA)
【Mayuri】What do you mean-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D04)
【Itaru】I went into SERN's database and got a data table.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D14)
【Itaru】From there, I focused on people with simple passwords like 11111111 and ABCDEFGH to obtain an ID.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D2E)
【Itaru】It's best if the owner of that ID were a server manager, but I don't think we'd be that lucky.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D48)
【Mayuri】In Japanese please-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D58)
【Rintaro】Same.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D72)
【Itaru】In short, if the password belonged to a SERN server manager, then we could lick the entirety of SERN's body and see whatever we wanted, but if it's just an ordinary researcher's password, then we could only see its boobs, or something like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D82)
【Mayuri】Daru-kun, that's naughty-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D92)
【Rintaro】Don't use erotic examples. Basically, you mean the information we can see will be limited, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DAC)
【Itaru】Exactly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DC6)
【Itaru】Well, getting a server manager's password would only be a matter of time. Let's save that for later. I'm really sleepy now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DE0)
It would be cruel to push Daru any further.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF0)
It's unfortunate, but it can't be helped. Let's let him rest so he can be refreshed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E0C)
【Itaru】Ohh, looks like the ID we got belongs to an accelerator division official.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E1C)
【Rintaro】It's not a server manager then...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E64)
【Itaru】It would take a miracle to get one with our first try. How many staff members do you think SERN has?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EAC)
【Mayuri】How many?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EBC)
【Itaru】Over 6000.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ED6)
There's that many...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EF2)
【Itaru】Well, for now, this accelerator division official, uh his name is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F02)
【Itaru】Mr. Jack. Let's peep into his mail log.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F12)
As expected, the mails come up in English.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F5A)
【Mayuri】Uwawah-. Mayushii's head is starting to hurt...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6A)
Hmph. It's miserable to be flinching at the sight of English.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F86)
【Rintaro】Daru, what's written there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F96)
【Itaru】Need to translate it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FAE)
【Rintaro】Angle up the <DICT>Babel Fish</DICT>!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FBE)
【Itaru】I'm not gonna do something tedious like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FCE)
Daru boots up translation software and auto-translates the open page.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FDE)
Poor, unnatural Japanese shows up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FEE)
The first line said A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FFE)
【Itaru】Greeting like of New Year it does the~. Go on vacation in Spain... envy
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000300E)
That mail's contents were normal. Nothing out of the ordinary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000301E)
【Itaru】If we keep scouring the log like this, we can also identify the server manager.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003066)
【Mayuri】You know, looking through someone else's mail without permission makes me feel really sorry....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003150)
Mayuri gets depressed and moves away from the computer out of guilt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003160)
She silently sits on the sofa and sighs as she hugs the giant Upa cushion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003170)
What we're doing certainly is socially unacceptable. I recognize that. But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031E0)
【Rintaro】Having stepped foot on the path of evil long ago, I no longer know what guilt feels like, fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031F0)
【Rintaro】I shall take all responsibility. I have no intention to get either of you charged with guilt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003238)
【Itaru】Uhoh. I'd let Okarin do me in the butt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003248)
【Rintaro】I decline.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003262)
【Rintaro】So with that said, Daru, don't hesitate to peek.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003306)
【Mayuri】Okarin, you're bad-. Mayushii's a sad panda.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003316)
That's of no concern to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003326)
Don't be a hypocrite.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033D2)
Upon further examination, we discover several mails with the title Experiment report.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033E2)
Which means "実験報告" in Japanese.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033F2)
Looks like he sends this mail almost daily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003402)
【Rintaro】LHC experiment reports, huh. There could be a time machine hint in there. We should try opening it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003412)
【Itaru】It seems dangerous to look at it, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003422)
Daru says so while clicking that mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003432)
What came out is a cryptic series of symbols.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003442)
【Itaru】This is encrypted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003452)
【Rintaro】Tch, so it really wasn't that simple...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003462)
【Itaru】Well, it'll be a piece of cake to solve this level of encryption.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003472)
Nice, supah hakah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003482)
He's no doubt a genius.

In about 10 minutes, Daru's undone the security.

What takes more time is deciphering the confusingly translated Japanese.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000351E)
【Itaru】Umm, liberally translated...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003584)
【Itaru】"Hi, Pole"

#WRITE(PTR, $00003630)
【Rintaro】That acting's unnecessary.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000364A)
【Itaru】Ya think so...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B2)
【Itaru】"Uploaded today's experimental data to the server. The LHC's condition is excellent. Though, it is the "LHC' to the end."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C2)
【Itaru】"It's almost fickle like a cat, but it was surprisingly obedient this month. It would be great if it stayed in this condition forever."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D2)
【Itaru】"But don't you think this work isn't rewarding? This kitten-- or should I say large cat HAHAHAHA-- has been in operation for 9 years."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E2)
【Itaru】"This research that repaints human history should only be seen by a small group of people."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F2)
【Itaru】"In all actuality, if it was officially announced, it would become a scandal, don't you think?"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003702)
【Itaru】"Those guys around the world would probably say this: "Call Robert Zemeckiff to SERN right away. Then you could get him to make it in less than a year"."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003712)
【Rintaro】...9 years?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003722)
I rub my temples with my thumbs, waiting for Daru to finish reading.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003732)
Calm down. Sort it out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003792)
【Rintaro】Do you think there were any translation mistakes in that mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A2)
Does Daru notice something unnatural too? He's not joking like usual.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037EA)
【Itaru】If you believe in the translation software, there shouldn't be any mistakes, right? The Japanese certainly is strange here and there, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037FA)
【Rintaro】But something's weird then.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000380A)
【Rintaro】The LHC should've only been put into operation around spring last year. But if you read between the lines in this mail, it's been in operation for 9 years.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003824)
【Itaru】That's strange.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038D4)
The mail's send date is this year, 2010, so nine years ago is 2001.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038E4)
Yesterday on @channel, John Titor posted this:
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038F4)
"If you want to supplement that explanation, then you have no choice but to believe what they say."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003904)
"They have already succeeded at the creation of micro-black holes."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003914)
I gulp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003924)
If you read between the lines in this mail... there's the nuance that they're doing some sort of secret experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003934)
And Robert Zemeckiff is a super-famous Hollywood movie director.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003944)
He directed a trilogy of smash-hit time travel movies about 20 years ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003954)
I groan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003964)
Don't tell me... my expectations were correct?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003974)
SERN's hiding a major secret from the world?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003984)
And it's even research on time machines, or something related...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039E8)
【Rintaro】Daru. Examine it some more. Search for traces of time machine research.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A02)
【Itaru】Seriously...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A12)
I don't know if Daru was directing that to my order, or to SERN's secret.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A2E)
Either way, Daru takes my words to heart and begins tapping on the keyboard again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8E)
【Itaru】Hmm, there aren't any mails with the phrase "time machine" in them...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A9E)
【Itaru】But the phrase "Z Program" is used hundreds of times in the past few months.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AAE)
【Itaru】Don't you think it could be the experiments they're doing with the LHC right now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ABE)
【Rintaro】What is it specifically? Black hole formation experiments?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ACE)
【Itaru】Hmmm, let's look for a document... ah, found one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ADE)
Daru opens up a PDF file sent as an attachment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AEE)
【Itaru】Hohoh-, looks like this is top secret stuff from France, England, and Holland.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AFE)
【Rintaro】...top secret national affairs?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B0E)
【Itaru】SERN's not even a national organization, so why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B1E)
【Itaru】Anyway, top secret national affairs? This bad, isn't it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B2E)
【Rintaro】Don't care. Examine the details.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B3E)
【Itaru】No, no. If we get caught, we won't just be sorry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B4E)
【Rintaro】Are you so incompetent at hacking that you'd get tracked?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B5E)
【Itaru】...I did it in a way that can't be tracked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B6E)
【Rintaro】Then I fail to see a problem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B7E)
【Itaru】Well, thanks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B8E)
Daru makes a slightly awkward face as he feeds a file detailing the Z Program into the translation software.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF4)
【Itaru】Hmm, "May 14 #137th Z Program Experiment Report"...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C04)
【Itaru】
"Because the mission of mini-black hole formation has already been established, the report is omitted. First--"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C14)
【Rintaro】Stop! Stop!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C74)
All of a sudden, Titor's "prediction" became reality...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C84)
【Rintaro】So SERN did use the LHC to successfully generate mini-black holes...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C94)
【Itaru】Officially, they announced that they still haven't succeeded with the experiments, so why...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CA4)
When Titor posted believe what they say, that's what he was referring to.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CB4)
【Itaru】In the first place, the experiment's goal was to create new particle reactions, not generate mini-black holes....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CC4)
Daru doesn't take his wide eyes off the monitor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CD4)
【Rintaro】But in reality, they're already generating mini-black holes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CE4)
【Itaru】Seems like it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CF4)
【Rintaro】What's written after that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D04)
【Itaru】Umm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D64)
【Itaru】"Experimental results: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, consult the enclosed Jellyman's Report No.14."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D74)
【Itaru】"Unless lifter adjustment, as well as each local field conformity position can be fixed, it is proposed that the experiments must be terminated."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D84)
【Rintaro】Wh-what does that mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D94)
【Itaru】Human is dead means that somebody died, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DBC)
【Rintaro】Wha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DCC)
Somebody died?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DDC)
Seriously?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DEC)
I groan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DFC)
Th-this isn't a joke anymore.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E0C)
We've might've gotten involved in something outrageous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E1C)
Maybe we've fallen and we can't get up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E2C)
We've stirred up a hornet's nest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ECA)
Pfft, who gives a damn?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EDA)
I-I'm not afraid. After all, I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EEA)
We can't stop after coming this far.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EFA)
I can't control my curiosity. And watching an actual evil deed take place without doing anything about it just leaves a bad taste.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F0A)
My throat has gone dry from the strain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F1A)
I swallow down my spit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F2A)
In an attempt to keep whatever composure I can, I scold myself for trying to run away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F8E)
【Rintaro】What is this Jellyman's Report?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F9E)
Daru starts typing once I ask my question, but he soon clicks his tongue.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FE6)
【Itaru】Well, I can't find it in Mr. Jack's mail. We need to get a hold of a higher up or a server manager's password.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FF6)
【Rintaro】Then we'll postpone that. Search for tings related to time machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004010)
【Itaru】But nothing's going to turn up, you know~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004050)
After that, Daru spends about 15 minutes fishing through the accelerator division official's mail, but can't find anything about time machines after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004098)
【Itaru】Words like accelerator technical committee, and LHC project official came out, so I guess we should look for an ID from there. Maybe we can get more detailed information from them.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040A8)
【Rintaro】You can't examine it using Mr. Jack's ID?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B8)
Daru nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C8)
【Rintaro】Well then, let's stop for today...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040E2)
【Itaru】By the way, what we saw just now was SERN's biggest server, but there's actually another one, a strange database.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040F2)
【Rintaro】Strange, in what way?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004102)
【Itaru】...It was buggy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004112)
【Rintaro】Buggy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000412C)
【Itaru】Well, buggy, or rather, something that seemed like program code came up....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004146)
【Itaru】It was too ambiguous and confusing, or rather, utterly impossible to decode, thank you very much, or rather
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004156)
【Rintaro】Could it be encrypted?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004170)
【Itaru】That's not a cipher I've ever seen. It couldn't come into existence as a program in the first place. It just bothers me as to why they would have a database like that that nobody could see.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004180)
【Rintaro】That does bother me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000419A)
【Itaru】I'll try analyzing it for a bit.
