I assemble all the lab mems, including Moeka, and solemnly begin to talk.

【Rintaro】Let us commence the 73rd Round Table Conference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000520)
【Kurisu】Yesterday was the 66th. Where'd the other six disappear to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000546)
【Rintaro】The only ones who care about the minor details are anal retentive bastards. That's why you'll never be more than an assistant, Christina!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000556)
【Kurisu】Like I've said over and over, I'm not your assistant or Christina.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000566)
Let's leave Kurisu and her complaints alone for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000058C)
【Rintaro】For the first stage of Operation "Urd", we sent D-mails to inspect D-mail ability.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D4)
The result: we confirmed the limit of 3 lines of 6 full width or 12 half width characters each.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E4)
【Rintaro】With today's experiment, we advance to the second stage, practical applications of D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F4)
【Mayuri】Practical applications, huh? I'll be sure to send one to this morning, so I can say "Good morning, Okarin♪"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000604)
【Rintaro】Like hell you will. Write that on the back of a leaflet or something.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000614)
【Mayuri】Ehh-? But if it's on the back of a leaflet, it won't get to Okarin-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000065C)
【Rintaro】What I mean by practical application is basically--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000066C)
I take a short pause to look at all four members. Then I lower my voice--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000067C)
【Rintaro】Whether or not we can change the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000068C)
Waves of commotion spread.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006D4)
【Kurisu】Wait just a second. That's too dangerous! You trying to become a god!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006E4)
【Rintaro】Huh, Assistant. What exactly is dangerous?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000006F4)
【Kurisu】Time paradoxes. Let's say you create a time paradox, instantly blowing away the world. What do you plan to do then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000704)
【Rintaro】Both you and I would be dead then, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000714)
【Kurisu】You're going to change the past so thoughtlessly? You joking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000724)
【Kurisu】Don't tell me... you're not seriously going to bring chaos to the world or whatever for real, are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000880)
【Itaru】No, no, of course not~. Makise-shi, you can just ignore what Okarin says, OK?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089A)
【Kurisu】Eh, r-really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B4)
【Mayuri】It's okay-. You know, Okarin's really a very nice person-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000095C)
【Rintaro】I don't remember asking for an appraisal, but I'll answer Christina's question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000096C)
【Rintaro】My ambition certainly is to bring chaos unto the world. However, preparations are still too incomplete to bring that ambition to fruition.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000097C)
【Rintaro】If we can only send a 36 byte mail, that's not enough at all, don't you think?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098C)
【Rintaro】Therefore, I shall leave my ambition-- "Project Chaotic"-- aside for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000099C)
【Moeka】Project Chaotic...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009AC)
【Kurisu】Improv?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A92)
【Itaru】Makise-shi, correct!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB0)
【Kurisu】YES
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACA)
【Itaru】"I thought it up on the spot, so I just went ahead and said it." Okarin's always like that, eh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B72)
【Rintaro】Don't analyze me, Daru! You too, Assistant! Stop that victorious guts pose! You making fun of me!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B82)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey, so what sort of applications do you mean by practical applications-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B92)
【Itaru】More details on concrete past-changing contents, please.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB8)
【Rintaro】...Firstly, don't forget that this is only a verification experiment. All we need to do is check if we can change the past. It doesn't matter how small the change is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC8)
【Kurisu】Okabe, do you know about the Butterfly Effect?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C10)
【Rintaro】Of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C20)
【Itaru】Yeah, it's that saying. When the wind blows, the bucket maker gains.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C30)
【Kurisu】Eh? No, it's kinda like that, but kinda not...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C40)
【Rintaro】A butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing and a storm happens in New York, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C58)
【Kurisu】Yeah, that. Part of "<DICT>Chaos Theory</DICT>"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C68)
【Kurisu】Basically, even if it's something "trivial" like you say, an intentional change could have a significant influence on the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C78)
【Kurisu】How do you plan to take responsibility for that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C88)
【Rintaro】Titor said this: the many-worlds interpretation holds true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CD0)
【Kurisu】So you're saying that makes it okay to change the past? You believe in that suspicious would-be time traveler's delusion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CE0)
【Rintaro】Can you prove it's a delusion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CF0)
【Kurisu】I'm asking what you're going to do when your delusional foundation collapses underneath you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E0E)
Kurisu and I glare at each other.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E1E)
For some reason, whenever I talk to this impertinent assistant, I end up emotional.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E2E)
That's not like you, mad scientist Hououin Kyouma. Calm down a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E9E)
【Rintaro】Christina, you said this before, did you not?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EAE)
【Rintaro】When a theory is "observed" after laying down hypotheses, it becomes real. That's how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBE)
【Rintaro】You're contradicting yourself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ECE)
【Kurisu】No. I am not.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDE)
【Kurisu】The Microwave Ophone's principle is still not even constructed of hypotheses.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEE)
【Kurisu】You could say we're still fumbling around. There are too many risks to try changing the past in our current state.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFE)
【Kurisu】We should at least investigate a little more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F0E)
Hmmm? So it's not like she's unconditionally against it then?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F34)
【Rintaro】You're actually just itching to try it out, aren't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F44)
【Kurisu】Th-that's...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F54)
Kurisu quickly looks away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F64)
【Rintaro】Anyway, Assistant, didn't you want to deny that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) was a time machine?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F74)
【Rintaro】If it's not a time machine, then it can't change the past. You could prove that, so why are you against it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F84)
【Kurisu】Oh shut up...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F94)
【Rintaro】And if you're going to talk about time paradoxes, then what about SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FDC)
【Rintaro】They've already sent more than 100 people into the past. It wouldn't be strange even if one or two time paradoxes happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
【Kurisu】So you want to stoop to the same level as the guys that did those inhumane experiments?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001098)
【Rintaro】We're not doing human testing or anything, so relax.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001212)
【Mayuri】Hey, hey.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B6)
Until now, Mayuri had been staring blankly as Kurisu and I debated. But now, oddly enough, she's raising her hand to talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001364)
【Mayuri】Okarin, Okarin. You know, Mayushii doesn't really get it, but by changing the past, what will you change and how-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001408)
Finally, some constructive conversation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000150C)
【Rintaro】Well then, allow me to answer. If I were to say what it is I want to do for this operation, it would be...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015C6)
【Rintaro】To win the lottery!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170C)
Everyone except for Moeka stares blankly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BA)
【Itaru】I agree. If we have money, I could buy all the computer parts I want, and go to MayQueen for all five meals of the day. It would be stranger if we didn't try it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)
As expected of Daru. Quick to the punch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001916)
【Mayuri】So it's money, huh-, Okarin... That makes Mayushii sad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019C4)
【Mayuri】We should do something that would bring peace to the world-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A72)
【Mayuri】Like, if we gave everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B20)
【Rintaro】Hmph, peace to the world, you say? What's with the hypocrisy?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC4)
【Rintaro】Who do you think I am? I am the insane mad scientist, Houou--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C72)
【Kurisu】Okabe, that's too low a motive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D16)
Tch, is everyone a hypocrite here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E1A)
【Rintaro】In the first place, don't get the meaning wrong.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EBE)
【Rintaro】This has nothing to do with world peace or motives. This is an experiment to check whether or not we can change the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F62)
【Rintaro】The easiest thing to understand is if we can win the lottery or not, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002006)
【Kurisu】But your primary goal is the money, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020C0)
【Rintaro】If I had the money, I could say goodbye to this rickety old building. Fuhahaha! I could get an office in Daibiru or UPX!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002164)
【Kurisu】See, just like I thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002208)
【Rintaro】I won't whitewash it. If we moved, we could experiment as much as we want without the fear of the muscular manager downstairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022AC)
【Rintaro】Also, if we had a million yen, we can buy a truckload of Mayuri's favorite bananas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242E)
【Mayuri】Eh,
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002448)
 a t-truckload...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000255C)
【Kurisu】Mayuri-san, don't let this miser mislead you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002600)
【Rintaro】Shut it, Celeb Seventeen!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026AE)
【Kurisu】S-se... Serendipity?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002752)
【Rintaro】Celeb. Seventeen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002800)
【Kurisu】'the hell is that supposed to mean...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028A4)
【Rintaro】You live in a hotel off of your parents' money. You're in no place to call other people misers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002952)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F6)
Kurisu makes an unabashedly sulky face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A9A)
She put in a retort like In the first place, I'm 18 now! but I gloriously ignored it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B3E)
It doesn't matter if she's 17 or 18. The feeling of the words is everything!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BE2)
【Kurisu】Moeka-san, what do you think?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C86)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D2A)
No reaction from Moeka.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DE0)
【Kurisu】Hm-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF8)
Heheheh, her distress flare got shot down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E08)
What Moeka's thinking is a mystery to me, but I'll treat her lack of opposition as "yes" .
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E78)
【Rintaro】If you're going to complain, then suggest an alternative plan. Something that can change the past with an easy to understand "trivial event". Got anything?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E88)
【Kurisu】Umm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E98)
【Mayuri】Hm-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EA8)
【Kurisu】Let's try changing the hotel I'm staying at.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EB8)
Kurisu's voice lacks conviction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EC8)
【Rintaro】That's completely unrelated to us. Celeb Seventeen, if you want to stay in Shinagawa or Uguisudani, then just move there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002ED8)
【Kurisu】...You don't have to say it like that, do you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE8)
【Itaru】Anyway, why Uguisudani?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EF8)
【Rintaro】Because there's a love hotel zone over th--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FE6)
【Kurisu】If you're going to spout nonsense like that, I'll perform a <DICT>lobotomy</DICT> on you and scrape out your frontal lobe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FF6)
Hyeeehhhh, a lobotomy? How mad scientisty...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003010)
【Mayuri】Then, how about we change my usual Juicy Karaage Number One for Chicken Bite Karaage-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000302E)
【Rintaro】Mayuri, you're always scarf down karaage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003048)
【Mayuri】Eh-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030B2)
Silence descends upon us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030C2)
Kurisu and Mayuri's eyes wander in thought, but it doesn't look like they have any good ideas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030D2)
Moeka... I never can tell what she's thinking. Maybe she's not even thinking. She's been staring at her phone without so much as moving her eyebrows, or even her fingers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030E2)
Daru declared support for me, so he's browsing moe news sites as if this whole thing doesn't concern him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003102)
【Rintaro】So in the end, even with a time machine before you all, this is all you can think of. You guys sure lack imagination, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003112)
【Rintaro】If you have no alternative plans, we'll use mine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003122)
【Kurisu】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003132)
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003142)
So, after all, she does want to see if we can change the past too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003152)
She is a pure scientist after all. She has the characteristics of a mad scientist too, heheheh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031A4)
I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031B4)
【Rintaro】...It's me. We will now move Operation Urd to the second stage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031C4)
【Rintaro】...Yeah, no problem. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall take all responsibility. ...Hmph, don't be a nuisance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031D4)
【Rintaro】...Correct. This is my choice, and also Steins;Gate's choice. Operation "Ragnarok" is near. ...El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031EA)
I put away my phone and look around the lab mems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031FA)
【Rintaro】Now, operation start!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000329E)
Nobody moves a muscle. They just exchange glances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032AE)
【Itaru】You tell us to start, but what exactly is it we should do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032BE)
【Rintaro】Are you incapable of doing anything without my instructions?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032D8)
【Mayuri】First- we need to buy a lottery ticket.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032F2)
【Kurisu】No, we need to get hold of a past winning number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000330C)
【Rintaro】Exactly, Celeb Seventeen. You understand, don't you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003326)
【Kurisu】...don't call me Celeb Seventeen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003340)
【Itaru】Anyway, there are different types of lotteries, you know? Think we should go with Dream Summer Jumbo?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000335A)
【Mayuri】Ah, I saw a TV commercial for that the other day-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003374)
【Rintaro】Did they announce the winners?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000338E)
【Itaru】Should be next week or the week after.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000339E)
【Rintaro】There's no meaning then! We can only send D-mails to the past, you know!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033B8)
【Itaru】Yeah-, that's true.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033D2)
【Itaru】Then, we could wait until the Summer Jumbo drawing date.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033E2)
【Rintaro】You've got your priorities backwards. Don't get fixated on the Summer Jumbo. Let's look for the latest lottery to have announced its winners.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033FC)
【Itaru】Hmmm, I'll go google it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003418)
Daru starts searching on his computer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003428)
Kurisu's seriously troubled, as Kurisus are wont to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003438)
【Kurisu】If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003452)
【Mayuri】You know, Mayushii doesn't know how to buy a lottery ticket in the first place-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000346C)
【Kurisu】That's true. I don't think teenage girls buy lottery tickets.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000347C)
【Rintaro】Moeka, have you bought one?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035CA)
When I call out to Moeka standing alone in the corner of the room, her shoulder's twitch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000035E4)
Then she shakes her head a little bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000360A)
【Mayuri】Okarin, have you bought one-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003682)
【Rintaro】...I've tried the <DICT>LOTO SIX</DICT> once.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003692)
Result, utter failure. Not even a penny.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036A2)
【Itaru】Ahh, LOTO SIX might be just perfect. I'm pretty sure they announce winning numbers every week.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B2)
Promptly searching on the net, we find out hat LOTO SIX announces winning numbers every Thursday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036C2)
They've also uploaded last week's 1st through 7th place numbers on the homepage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D2)
【Mayuri】Are you going to send this winning number in a D-mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E2)
【Rintaro】Exactly. Though, of course, we have to mention it's a winning LOTO SIX number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F2)
【Itaru】Hmm, last week's 1st prize was... woah, 200 million!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003718)
What, 200 million!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003728)
That was more money than I had expected, so my heart skipped a beat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003738)
【Rintaro】N-no, wait! 1st is too much....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003748)
【Itaru】Why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003758)
【Kurisu】200 million... that really is surprising, isn't it? hahahah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003768)
【Rintaro】No, not that. 1st would be... too conspicuous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003778)
【Kurisu】Haah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003788)
【Rintaro】Don't you get it!? I'm being chased by the "Organization". If we won 1st prize in the LOTO SIX, the media would cover the event, so our presence would be known.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003798)
【Kurisu】It won't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037A8)
【Mayuri】Then, why not just have Mayushii win-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037B8)
【Rintaro】No good. Stage 2 of Operation Urd's does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev over there said.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037C8)
【Kurisu】Celeb Sev... don't abbreviate it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037D8)
【Rintaro】In order to take responsibility, I'll be winner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037E8)
【Kurisu】You're not just going to take all the money for yourself, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037F8)
I ignore Celeb Sev's straight man act.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003808)
The prospect of hogging 200 million yen certainly is appetizing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003818)
That amount of money is too big a change to the past. Just like Celeb Sev said just now, we can't ignore the Butterfly Effect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003828)
I-I'm not nervous at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384E)
【Rintaro】With that said, we'd be too conspicuous, so let's try aiming for 2nd prize. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000385E)
【Itaru】Umm, last time the dividend was... 23 million yen.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000386E)
【Rintaro】...l-let's try aiming for 3d prize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000387E)
【Itaru】That decreases it to 700,000 yen, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000388E)
【Rintaro】Ah, yeah, that's good. That should be about right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000389E)
【Kurisu】So Okabe's a chicken, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038AE)
【Rintaro】Heh, heheheh...! That's not something you should say after worrying so much about the risk of time paradoxes, dontcha think, Celeb Sev!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038BE)
【Kurisu】I'm begging you, please stop calling me that... I'll settle for Assistant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038CE)
【Kurisu】Besides, I don't get your line of thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038DE)
【Rintaro】You're considering risks, and deciding if it's too much or too little money. You're the stubborn one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038EE)
【Kurisu】...How's that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000038FE)
I let Celeb Sev talk.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000390E)
【Mayuri】Uhmmm, with 700,000 yen, could we fill a truckload of bananas-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000391E)
She didn't say anything about using the entire dividend on bananas, but it looks like Mayuri intends to do so. Let's ignore the glutton for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000392E)
【Itaru】For 3rd prize, you need to get five matching numbers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000393E)
Last week's six winning numbers are 02 12 19 34 35 and 40. The bonus number is 08.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000394E)
1st prize is matching all 6 numbers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000395E)
2nd prize is matching 5 numbers plus the bonus number.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000396E)
3rd prize is matching only 5 numbers.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000397E)
【Rintaro】Moeka. I assign to you your first duty as a new lab mem.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A6E)
【Moeka】Eh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A7E)
Moeka stares in wonder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A8E)
Seems she didn't expect her name to be called.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A9E)
【Rintaro】Think of what to send in the D-mail. Think of something that would convince an unknowing me one week ago to buy into the LOTO SIX.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AAE)
【Moeka】Me...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003ABE)
【Rintaro】You are the mail demon, so this should be your strong point, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AD8)
【Moeka】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AF2)
She doesn't seem that interested, but Moeka nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B88)
We set the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B98)
We register the forwarding mail address into the X68000 attached to the microwave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BA8)
That address is my phone's, of course.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003BF0)
【Kurisu】Thursday last week, so about five days ago, right? Sending your D-mail there?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C00)
Putting on the white coat, Kurisu double checks the dedicated phone attached to the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C48)
【Itaru】The drawing was five days ago, so we have to send it to before then, don't we?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C62)
【Kurisu】In that case, one week ago, huh? 7 days is 168 hours, so let's round a bit and set it to 170#.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CAA)
【Mayuri】Ummm, 1, 7, 0, #...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003CF2)
Moeka finished writing the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D02)
She already punched in the text on my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DAC)

<ENDPANEL>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD4)
For the number, we replaced the 40 with 37.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DE4)
This way, we should eliminate the possibility of 1st and 2nd prize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DF4)
【Rintaro】Well, this should be it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E04)
We know that we can only send 36 bytes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E8C)
【Mayuri】This kinda looks suspicious, doesn't it- Ehheheh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EA6)
【Moeka】...I'll redo it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EB6)
I hurriedly stop Moeka from erasing the mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EC6)
【Rintaro】This is fine. I don't think there's any other way. Though, it certainly is suspicious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EE0)
【Mayuri】It'll be fine-. Actually, Okarin loves suspicious things, so I think it's perfect-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EF0)
That's not entirely incorrect, but it feels like she's making fun of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F0C)
Preparations complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F1C)
We're sending a mail across space-time, but preparing for that is surprisingly simple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F2C)
【Rintaro】Now... it's time to open Steins;Gate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003F74)
【Kurisu】It's been bugging me, but what is that stain's gait thing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FBC)
【Mayuri】It's Okarin's catch phrase-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FCC)
【Rintaro】Steins;Gate is Steins;Gate. Nothing more, nothing less.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FE6)
【Kurisu】That doesn't explain anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003FF6)
【Rintaro】Don't complain about every single thing. That's not what we should be thinking about now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004070)
I place my finger on my phone's send button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004080)
I desperately try to stop that finger from trembling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C8)
【Itaru】Welp, starting up the microwave-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D8)
I gulp down my saliva.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000413E)
The turntable begins to revolve in the microwave without a door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000414E)
With a thunderous roar, discharge begins to fire off into empty space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000415E)
The timer ticks down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000416E)
163... 162... 161...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000417E)
Change the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000418E)
It seems very simple to do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000419E)
But just like Kurisu said, our foundation might collapse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041AE)
I said I'd take responsibility. But that was just talk in the end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041BE)
If a time paradox occurs, the world might take irreparable damage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041CE)
150... 149... 148...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000041DE)
Damage the likes of me can't even begin to compensate for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043CC)
The discharge phenomenon occurs inside the microwave.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043DC)
All is well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043EC)
Now I just need to press the send button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043FC)
136... 135... 134...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000440C)
Can't stop now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000441C)
Because I'm looking ahead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000442C)
Curiosity pushes me from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000443C)
There's no way this will destroy the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000444C)
That's what I tell myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000445C)
122... 121... 120...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000446C)
【Rintaro】El Psy Congroo...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000447C)
I put strength into my button finger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044A0)
My phone displays a flying mail animation and the word "Sending".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044B0)
116... 115...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044C0)
Finally, that word changes to "Sent" and--
