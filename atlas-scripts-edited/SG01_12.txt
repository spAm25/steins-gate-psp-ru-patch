I want to find out the secret behind it's mysterious function.

#WRITE(PTR, $000001DE)
Recently, I asked Daru to connect the Microwave Ophone (Temp) to the PC.

#WRITE(PTR, $000001EE)
He finished setting it up yesterday, and now he's doing the wiring in the development room.

【Rintaro】Hey, Daru. Why the <DICT>X68000</DICT>?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000288)
It's a machine that's older than 20 years and has extremely low specs...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002D0)
【Itaru】Obviously because it's romance, hurr.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E8)
【Rintaro】So, it's the same reason as for certain Japanese protagonists being <DICT>odd-eyed</DICT>?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000302)
【Itaru】Not getting you, bro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000312)
【Rintaro】Romance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000032C)
【Itaru】Well, if it's romance, then I guess it can't be helped.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000033C)
【Itaru】In any case, there weren't any other PCs I could use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000034C)
【Rintaro】What about your newest one?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000366)
【Itaru】Don't screw around. If I connected my PC to something this ridiculous, it might stop functioning properly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000376)
What a selfish guy...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000386)
Also, we're the ones who made Microwave Ophone (Temp), so I'd like it if he didn't call it "ridiculous".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003A0)
【Itaru】So, did you do research on the gellification?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003B0)
【Rintaro】Yeah, I went to the university this morning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003C0)
Yes, I went to the university in the middle of the summer holidays to find out why and under what conditions the banana became gelatinous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003D0)
【Rintaro】By looking through a microscope, I found out that it was shredded at the molecular level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000003EA)
【Itaru】Shredded?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000402)
【Rintaro】It didn't look like the result of a <DICT>phase transition</DICT>. It became something that wasn't an actual banana...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000041C)
【Itaru】It... can't be corrosion, right? It's not possible for corrosion to occur in only 2 minutes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000434)
【Rintaro】...I just remembered <DICT>fractal structures</DICT>.

#WRITE(PTR, $0000044C)
【Itaru】<DICT>Menger's sponge</DICT>, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000045C)
【Rintaro】Yes. It looked like infinite fractal-shaped holes opened up in the banana at the nano level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000476)
【Itaru】Isn't that dangerous? What is happening here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000486)
【Rintaro】...I have one hypothesis.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000496)
As if to put on an air of importance, I become silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004B0)
Daru gulps down his saliva.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004C0)
【Rintaro】The hypothesis is that it's the effect of the microwave oven's electromagnetic waves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004DA)
【Itaru】Eh, what do you mea--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000004EA)
【Rintaro】The Microwave Ophone (Temp) has the potential to become a powerful weapon of mass destruction. We can rewrite the history of war. Kukuku.

#WRITE(PTR, $000004FA)
I distort my lips to look evil.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000050A)
Then, after taking out my cellphone, I put it against my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000534)
【Rintaro】...It's me. The plan has reached the second stage... Yes, they will know about it in due time. The Judgement Day Grand Punishment is close.

【Itaru】Quit talking with your fairies. I'm done with the connecting.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000574)
I want to explain to him that I'm not speaking to fairies, but I can't do it.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000584)
If I were to reveal their identity, I would be treated as a traitor.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000594)
Then I would become the enemy of other troublesome opponents, while still fighting the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000069E)
Now that the Microwave Ophone (Temp) is covered in wires, it really does look ridiculous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074A)
Even though we only connected it to the PC, the result looks like the work of something evil.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007F6)
The reason we did this connection is to allow us to control the business purpose <DICT>terminal modes</DICT> and to observe the oven's operation status.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D2)
【Itaru】So, what shall we do?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000976)
【Rintaro】Prepare the bananas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AB8)
Before I left "MayQueen+Nyan⑯", Mayuri asked me to buy bananas.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B5C)
The money that I used to buy them belongs to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
What a tractable girl. I don't know whether to call her a nonchalant idiot or just softhearted.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAE)
She can't even predict that if she lets me buy the bananas, I will only use them up for experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D90)
And so, I put the bunch of bananas into the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E3E)
【Itaru】If you use it all, Mayushi will be sad, y'know? You bought the bananas with her money, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE2)
【Rintaro】The money that she gave were research funds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F86)
【Itaru】Anyway, you don't have to use the whole thing, bro. Just 1 is enough.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001036)
Daru plucks a single banana from the bunch and places it inside the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010DA)
【Rintaro】We can't reconstruct the world's ruling structure if we are stingy with money.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011B6)
【Itaru】You're the only one who wants to reconstruct it or whatever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000125A)
He lost all enthusiasm upon coming back to the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001310)
What an inconsistent guy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001376)
【Itaru】Come on, start the timer with your cellphone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013BE)
Now, where did I put it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013DC)
Phone, phone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000153E)
Calling complete.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000154E)

#WRITE(PTR, $0000156A)
【Mayuri2】R-E-N-G. This is the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001586)
The Mayushii Guidance begins.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A2)
【Mayuri2】From here, you can control the timer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015B2)
【Mayuri2】After entering #, please input the heating time in seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CE)
【Rintaro】We're gonna have to add a skip function to the Mayushii Guidance. Waiting like this is irritating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EA)
【Mayuri2】For example, 1 minute would be "#60".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FA)
【Mayuri2】2 minutes would be "#120".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001616)
The guidance is finally over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001626)
I shall input "120#".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001662)
Once I enter the symbols, the Microwave Ophone (Temp) begins working, emitting a low buzzing sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AA)
【Itaru】You've done it wrong, bro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
Crap, this is normal heating.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016E8)
I return the timer to 0, and restart from the beginning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016F8)
I have to disregard the guidance and input "120#".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170C)
Crap, I made a mistake.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171C)
Let's try again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172C)
Ignore the guidance and input "120#".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001740)
Inputting complete.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001762)
The turntable inside the Microwave Ophone starts rotating in the opposite direction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001772)
【Rintaro】2 minutes sure is a long time...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001782)
We don't even know if it really must be 2 minutes, but this was the setting the first time that Mayuri discovered the "freezing" function, so we use it in our experiments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001792)
Of course, we tried 60 and 180 seconds, as well.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A2)
If we set it shorter than 120, the freezing either stops halfway or nothing happens at all, while setting it longer makes the changes even larger.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017EA)
【Itaru】But, if it happens because of the electromagnetic waves, shouldn't it affect our cells, too?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FA)
After being silent for a while, Daru asks that question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180A)
【Rintaro】Well, did you ever try heating yourself in the Microwave Ophone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001824)
【Itaru】There's no way I could fit there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001834)
【Itaru】Anyway, what's the sauce on this being the effect of the electromagnetic waves.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001844)
【Rintaro】If I were to put it to words... The intuition of a mad scientist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185E)
【Itaru】Oh, so there's no basis for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000186E)
【Rintaro】Edison once said that "If there's no 1％ inspiration, the 99％ perspiration is wasted. That's why, inventor, be inspired!"
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
【Itaru】Wasn't it "Genius is 1％ inspiration, 99％ perspiration"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001898)
【Rintaro】No. In the recent years, it has become widely known that that quote is wrong. Fwahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A8)
【Itaru】So you're telling me that Edison said "be inspired!"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B8)
【Rintaro】Yes, "be inspired!".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C8)
I don't know if that was exactly what he said, but I'm sure it was something along those lines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D8)
I only found this out recently on a wiki.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E8)
【Rintaro】Therefore I, a genius mad scientist, am always--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001914)
The Microwave Ophone (Temp) lets out a sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001924)
【Rintaro】Now that I think about it, by doing this, the banana will only become gelatinous again and we won't discover anything new.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001934)
I now feel like I wasted 120 seconds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001950)
Daru opens up the door of the Microwave Ophone (Temp) and looks inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001960)
Wha-, what is he disturbed about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001970)
【Itaru】Oh... Woahhh!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001980)
He's rubbing his eyes, blinking like crazy and is tilting his head in puzzlement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001990)
【Rintaro】What are you doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019D8)
【Itaru】No, ehmm... huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019E8)
【Itaru】...It's gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019F8)
【Rintaro】What's gone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A08)
【Itaru】The banana.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A24)
What the hell is he saying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A34)
Not understanding the situation, I push Daru aside and look inside the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A90)
【Rintaro】...Gone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA0)
...It's not here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB0)
The inside is completely empty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC0)
The banana that we put inside just about 120 seconds ago disappeared without a trace.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE8)
【Rintaro】...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
I take out my phone after a short sigh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B22)
And start speaking to the silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B32)
【Rintaro】...It's me. The situation became troublesome. Apparently, we have woken up something outrageous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B7A)
【Itaru】W-what do you mean by "something outrageous"!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
Daru is panicking besides me, but I ignore him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
My heart is beating fast due to the astonishment, but I try to look calm.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
【Rintaro】Put the emergency order number 666, "The Grim Seal Cooling-Off" into operation right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC6)
【Rintaro】What!? Government approval!? Are you stupid? There's no time for that! If this keeps up, the country is gonna blow up!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BDC)
After yelling, I put away my phone.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C34)
【Rintaro】Shut up you Faris' stalker. So, where did you hid the banana?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4E)
【Itaru】Who're you calling a stalker!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5E)
【Rintaro】Take out the BA NA NA, right now. Are you planning on becoming a street magician or something?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C98)
【Itaru】...

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CA8)
An uncomfortable silence.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CB8)
I just realized that my throat is all dried up.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CC8)
【Rintaro】Why did it disappear!?

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CE2)
【Itaru】I dunno!

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D3E)
【Rintaro】Where did you go, banaana! BANAANAAA!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4E)
I take out the turntable of the microwave oven and look all over it, but I can't find a single trace of the banana.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DD4)

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DFE)
【Itaru】Ehmm, for now, we should calm down.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E0E)
【Rintaro】Y, yeah. That's right...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E1E)
We both take deep breaths.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E2E)
Right, I will eat a banana to calm down.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E4A)
I extend my hand towards the banana bunch while thinking that.

The banana bunch that Mayuri asked me to buy.

About 3 minutes ago, Daru picked a banana from it and put it in the Microwave Ophone (Temp).
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE2)
...Or so it should've been.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF2)
But now, there's not even a trace of a banana ever being picked.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F02)
And instead of it, there's a gelified banana, perfectly connected to the rest of the bunch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F4A)
【Itaru】Wh, what the hell!? What's happening here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F5A)
Looks like Daru noticed, as well.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F6A)
In a state of confusion, I tried to touch it, but restrained myself.

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F94)
【Itaru】P, probably only these...

Is the place where the gelbana is right now the same place where you took the banana from?
<END>

Besides being gelified, it looks very natural. It doesn't look like a trick at all.

By which I mean that it doesn't seem like someone took a banana, gelified it, and then put the banana back.
