When the butler guides me into the room, Faris is on the sofa, hugging her knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000082A)
 She doesn't raise her face even when I approach.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000083A)
【Rintaro】Faris, we finally got together. I have something to ask you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000084A)
【Faris】Hmmya~...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000085A)
An exhausted expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000086A)
A voice missing its core.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000087A)
Not a particle of ambition or livelihood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000088A)
【Rintaro】What happened? You look down...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000089A)
【Faris】...This can't be... happening to meow. Why did Faris have to lose nyan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008AA)
【Faris】...if only those guys... didn't use underpawed tricks on meow... They ganged up on Faris...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008BA)
【Faris】I even promised I would absolutely win... Papa's probably disappointed in meow... I'm too afraid to show my face nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008CA)
What is she saying?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DA)
No, wait.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008EA)
It came to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008FA)
After Faris fought in the RaiNet AB GrandChamp finals.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000090A)
That unusual Gaia's whisper guy had just said former champ.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000091A)
Judging by that, the reason Faris is so depressed is because she lost the match.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000092A)
I feel bad for the depressed Faris, but I don't have time to deal with this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A00)
【Rintaro】Faris, please listen!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A10)
Faris blinks repeatedly when I grab both her shoulders.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A20)
But those eyes were hazy, depressed by some weight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A30)
【Rintaro】Earlier, you used the time machine we invented to send a D-mail. Do you remember that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A4A)
【Faris】Hanya...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A5A)
I tried to ask, but it was useless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A6A)
Faris doesn't remember that fact after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A7A)
It's not like she forgot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A8A)
From Faris' perspective, that fact never happened.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A9A)
Gh. Just how can I explain this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AAA)
【Rintaro】Try thinking, for example, that originally, here in Akiba, there were tons of shops that sold moe anime and game goods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ABA)
【Rintaro】And let's say, you used a time machine, and changed that Akiba into the electric town it is today. How would you do it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ACA)
I know it's a really cryptic question.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADA)
But all I had to ask.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000AFA)
【Faris】...time machine
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B0A)
Faris murmurs with a blank expression.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B1A)
【Faris】Time machine...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B2A)
She repeats the same phrase.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B3A)
The shine gradually returns to Faris' eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B4A)
And then, as if she thought of something--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA6)
【Faris】Kyouma...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C0A)
She flirtatiously leans on my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C1A)
【Rintaro】Eh, wait...!? What...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C2A)
She smells good.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C3A)
Faris' cat ears tickle my nose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4A)
I went stiff not knowing what to do about her sudden action.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5A)
Faris looked up at me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6A)
She looked sad for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C7A)
I was flustered seeing Faris' expression this close.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C8A)
【Faris】Is the time machine real nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9A)
【Rintaro】...Yeah. For real.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAA)
【Faris】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBA)
Faris stares at me even more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCA)
It felt as if she were peeking through my soul.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDA)
【Faris】I believe nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEA)
When I think she got convinced way too quickly, she suddenly starts rubbing her temples and hiding her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D10)
【Faris】Ugh... ugh... whew... ugh, I seem to remember nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D20)
【Rintaro】Huh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D30)
【Faris】Faris feels like she's used that time machine nyan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D40)
【Rintaro】Wha...!? Really!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D50)
【Faris】Umm, Faris rode the time machine and went pewww and...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D60)
【Rintaro】What? But what you used was a D-mail that can be sent into the past, though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D70)
【Faris】Nyanya! Right nya, I'm starting to remember more and more nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D80)
Then Faris holds her head, looking like she's about to cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D90)
【Faris】My head... hurts, nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DA0)
【Rintaro】What... does this mean...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DB0)
Does Faris also have the Reading Steiner ability?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DC0)
I don't know. I need to verify it, but how can I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DD0)
Umm, calm down. Just calm down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DE0)
Should I get in touch with Kurisu?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DF0)
Or...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E16)
【Faris】Kyouma... Faris... Faris...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E26)
Faris sticks closer and closer to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E36)
I couldn't do anything but catch her warm, soft, slender body in my arms.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E46)
I need to get her to remember somehow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EA2)
【Faris】My brains are turning to mush nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EB2)
【Rintaro】Hang in there!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EC2)
【Rintaro】Is there anything I can do...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EDC)
【Faris】If I win...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EEC)
【Faris】If I win, I might remember nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EFC)
【Rintaro】What? Win, at what...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F16)
【Faris】The Viral Attackers nyan. My opponents at todays match nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F26)
【Faris】But I lost because of their underpawed sabotage nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F36)
【Faris】Because of that, Faris' head is all mushy, so she can't remember her memories nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F46)
【Faris】Please nyan, Kyouma... Faris thinks if she wins the match, she'll remember everything nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F56)
【Faris】So let me use the time machine...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F6C)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F7C)
【Rintaro】By the way, you're not acting, are you?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA2)
【Faris】Wha-what are you talking about nya...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FB2)
Don't tell me she just wants to use the time machine so she can win her RaiNet match?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC2)
Considering how Faris usually acts, that's actually pretty likely.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FD2)
Since this girl's acting rivals that of minor demons.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FEC)
【Faris】Ugh, you're pawful...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FFC)
And Faris starts crying while clinging to my chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000100C)
【Faris】Even though Faris is trying her bestest to remember for Kyouma...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000101C)
【Faris】He called it acting, and hurt me nyan...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000102C)
【Rintaro】Ah, no, sorry...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000103C)
Large teardrops drip out from the corners of her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000104C)
I completely shrink back at the sight of tears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000105C)
Mmmmm... I don't think she'd lie and cry.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000106C)
But there really isn't a basis to remembering if she wins the RaiNet tournament...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001086)
【Faris】Please nya...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001096)
Faris whispers into my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A6)
【Faris】Let Faris win nya~n...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B6)
Right after that, I feel something warm and wet on my ear lobe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C6)
Faris play-bit me, sending electricity through my entire body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D6)
【Rintaro】...! Wh-wait! I get it, I get it, okay!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E6)
Faris hurriedly lets go.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F6)
That was dangerous, I seriously almost jizzed in my pants...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001106)
【Rintaro】O-Okay, Faris. We'll do what you say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001120)
【Faris】Really nyan!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001130)
【Rintaro】Yeah. Since I want you to remember no matter what.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001236)
Faris tries to leap into my chest out of happiness, but I evade.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001246)
She face dives into the sofa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000128E)
【Faris】Hnnya... why'd you dodge meow?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000129E)
【Rintaro】No... You're being way too familiar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012AE)
I really am bad at dealing with Faris. I can't help but feel she's forcing me to follow her flow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012BE)
...I really am being cheated, arent' I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012CE)
I shake that doubt out by force.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012DE)
I'll try anything if it could possibly yield results.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012EE)
In that case, I should naturally be able to answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012FE)
I desperately convince myself that, standing up tall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000130E)
【Rintaro】So after this, I'm going to leap to this morning and give you advice. Then you should be able to win. Is that okay?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001328)
【Faris】We're not sending a mail nyan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001338)
【Rintaro】Our lab has already developed a device that allows you to time leap, sending your consciousness into the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001352)
【Faris】Pawesome! So basically you can start a New Game nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001362)
【Rintaro】Umm, yeah, that's it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001372)
Don't go along with her, I desperately convince myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138C)
【Faris】Then if Faris uses that and leaps to this morning, it will be the cat's meow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000139C)
【Rintaro】No.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B6)
【Faris】Nya!? Why not nyan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C6)
【Rintaro】I don't want to let anyone besides me use the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E0)
【Faris】...Kyouma, that's meanya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013F0)
【Rintaro】...It's not something readily usable. It's dangerous.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001400)
I haven't failed once so far, but it might not be that way next time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001410)
I remember Suzuha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001420)
I remember how she lost her memories for 24 years when she time traveled.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001430)
That was a physical leap, using a feasible time machine, so its structure is different, but something similar could happen with the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001440)
That's to say nothing of how the Time Leap Machine was made under budget on a rushed schedule. It wouldn't be strange if it broke down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001450)
A breakdown, that is, the corruption of the time leaper's memories.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001460)
And one more thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001470)
I shouldn't let anyone else control modifications to the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001480)
Nobody should warp the world any more than this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001490)
My most important target is, to the very end, to return to the world line that has the IBN 5100. Because when I get the IBN 5100, I can escape from this α World Line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A0)
【Rintaro】I'm responsible for the changes to the past.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B0)
【Rintaro】Believe in me, Faris.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C0)
【Faris】...Okay nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A4)
TL15.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A84)
【Rintaro】...gh
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A94)
I brace my wobbling feet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA4)
My watch comes into my newly recovered vision.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AB4)
10:38AM. Time leap successful.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC4)
According to Faris, it seems she lost the match because the opposing team and their comrades had made clever, underhanded interferences during the competition.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD4)
Faris told me how she planned to counter that. The plan was--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC8)
【Faris】Bring Faris sunglasses and earplugs before the match nyan!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD8)
【Faris】Then she can ignore the interference and win 100％ nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C32)
I wonder if that's true...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C42)
No, now's no time for hesitation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C52)
I buy sunglasses and earplugs on the way to UPX.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C62)
Faris said she enters the assembly hall at 12.
