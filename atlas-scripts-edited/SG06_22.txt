Mayuri is merrymaking. Kurisu rushed over here after completing the Time Leap Machine, with a relieved look on her face.

Suzuha's forcibly attaching her beloved MTB to the satellite-like body. It seems like she really likes that MTB and intends to bring it with her to 1975.

Kurisu was worried if that might cause a time paradox.

Should I let Suzuha leave like this?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C4C)
That way of thinking is extremely conceited.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C5C)
Suzuha doesn't belong in this era in the first place, and if she gives the answer I don't especially want to stay in this era, then I won't have any reason to detain her.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C6C)
Suzuha finishes fastening her MTB and smiles calmly.

Because activating it would be too conspicuous.

So we're just going to wing it. There's no need to worry since we have the Time Leap Machine for insurance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBC)
If she has any regrets--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
It would be that we couldn't find her father.

Suzuha takes out her pin badge.

Her father's memento with the strange writing OSHM***A 7010.

In the end, we couldn't decipher that writing...

【Suzuha】Okabe Rintaro. I'll give this to you. You can just place it somewhere in that lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ED6)
【Rintaro】You...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EE6)
So Suzuha has lingering attachment to this era after all...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EF6)
Does she want to leave it behind?

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F06)
Does she want to leave behind the proof that the girl named Amane Suzuha lived in this era?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F16)
【Itaru】About the pin badge...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F98)
Daru timidly opens his mouth.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FA8)
【Itaru】What do you say we make duplicates for all the lab mems? As the lab mem' testiment.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000FC2)
【Mayuri】Wah-. That might be really good-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001040)
【Kurisu】That's oddly thoughtful of you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001050)
【Suzuha】Ahaha, somehow, if you use it like that, it kind of embarrasses me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001060)
【Itaru】Anyway, we already took a picture of it, so keep that badge, Amane-shi. It's your old man's precious memento, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000107A)
【Suzuha】Yeah... I'll do that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000108A)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010A6)
I don't say anything.

#WRITE(PTR, $000010B6)
I had detained Suzuha.

#WRITE(PTR, $000010C6)
But because of that, I couldn't save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010D6)
I--

#WRITE(PTR, $00001124)
【Mayuri】Hey, he-y! Dahdahdahda-h. Mayushii's has an important announcement to make-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001134)
Mayuri raises her hand, raising her voice in even higher spirits than before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001144)
I thought she was just being overly optimistic since she doesn't know about the time machine's one way limitation, but I'm interested in that important announcement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001154)
Just what is it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001164)
Don't tell me, did Mayuri find out... her fate to die in a few hours?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001174)
I quickly glance at Kurisu, but she just seems as confused as I am.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001184)
So, that important announcement...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001194)
【Mayuri】Actually, Mayushii found Suzu-san's father!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001240)
【Rintaro】Huh?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001250)
【Suzuha】Eh!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001260)
【Itaru】Seriously!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012B0)
Mayuri sticks out her chest in confidence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012C0)
【Mayuri】Wanna meet him-? You wanna meet him, dontcha-? So with that said, her father's here with us today-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012D0)
【Suzuha】W-where?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012E0)
Everyone besides Mayuri is stupidly looking about.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012F0)
The dreary Radio Kaikan event space. Nobody's here besides us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001300)
Wait, is he hiding at the entrance?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000131A)
【Mayuri】So now-, allow me to announce. Suzu-san's father--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000132A)
【Mayuri】Drrrrrrrrrrrr
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000133A)
【Itaru】Whoa, self drum roll!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001354)
【Mayuri】Tadidah! Suzu-san's father--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001364)
Ending her oral drum froll, Mayuri grins at Suzuha and--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000137E)
【Mayuri】Is Daru-kun!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000138E)
She points at Daru with a snap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013B6)
Everybody's mouthes drop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013C6)
After awkward silence comes awkward laughter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000140E)
【Kurisu】That logic is unacceptable as a joke. It's impossible for this pervert to get married in the first place.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001456)
【Itaru】Hey, that's kind of hurtful, you know...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001466)
【Rintaro】No, I completely agree with Christina. It's been decided that when Daru reaches age 30, he will class change into a wizard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001476)
【Itaru】Be nicer, yous guys. But it's the truth, so I can't object...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001516)
Heartbroken, Daru finally collapses on all fours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001526)
Suzuha herself gives a troubled reaction.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015A4)
【Suzuha】Hmm, my Father wasn't this fat in the first place, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015BE)
【Mayuri】Geez. You're all so mean to Daru-kun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016A0)
【Itaru】Uha, Mayu-shi's the only one to stand up for me. You're an angel. So will you fall in love with me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BA)
【Mayuri】Nope.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176A)
Daru, rejected with one word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177A)
【Mayuri】You know, by Mayushii's reasoning, Daru-kun abso-lutely must be Suzu-san's father-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017C2)
【Kurisu】So tell us. How can you prove it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017E4)
【Mayuri】You know, I've always been thinking about the writing on the pin badge-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017FE)
【Mayuri】And so, after staring at it, I noticed the 7 in the "7010" is a little bit weird.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000180E)
【Mayuri】This isn't a 7, it's a 2. It's just missing the bottom line.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000185E)
【Suzuha】Eh, really?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018AA)
Suzuha stares at the pin badge's writing again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018BA)
【Suzuha】It's so small, I can't tell...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018CA)
【Mayuri】If you magnify the picture, you'll notice-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018DA)
【Kurisu】2010? As in, AD? That's this year, isn't it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018EA)
【Rintaro】Then, what do the first letters mean?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018FA)
OSHM***A 7010
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000190A)
That's what's written on the pin badge.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000191A)
【Mayuri】It's simple-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000192A)
【Mayuri】Okabe, Shiina, Hashida, Makise. Lastly, Amane.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000193A)
【Itaru】Wait...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000194A)
That was an unexpected blind spot since it was so simple.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000195A)
【Itaru】It's the lab mem's initials!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000196A)
【Mayuri】So I was thinking about why 2010, when I remembered it's the year of the lab mems.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000197A)
I don't really get what the year of the lab mems is, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000198A)
【Mayuri】The Future Gadget Laboratory was founded this year.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000199A)
【Suzuha】So that's what it is...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A24)
【Mayuri】And you know? Whenever Suzu-san would talk about the future, stories of Okarin and Chris-chan would pop out, but there wasn't a single story about Daru-kun, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A34)
【Itaru】There weren't any about Mayu-shi either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A44)
Daru's obvious question startles me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A5E)
【Mayuri】That's because Mayushii's a lab mem, but she didn't make a time machine, and she doesn't like fighting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A6E)
...That's not it. The reason there aren't any stories of Mayuri is because she dies in a few hours. Knowing that fact, Kurisu and I, as well as Suzuha, say nothing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A7E)
【Mayuri】But you know, Daru-kun is a supah hakah, and Okarin's right hand man, and together they made Microwave Ophone-chan, so I thought it was strange he never came up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ACE)
【Kurisu】His name never came up, meaning he falsified his name, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE8)
【Mayuri】The people who founded Suzu-san's Resistance included Okarin and Mr. Barrel Titor, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B02)
【Mayuri】And he was someone in Akiba in 2010.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
【Mayuri】And he independently studied time machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B22)
【Mayuri】And Okabe's "Reading Spaghetti"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B32)
【Rintaro】"Reading Steiner".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B42)
【Mayuri】And he knows about that thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B5C)
【Mayuri】So, doesn't that fit Daru-kun perfectly?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6C)
【Kurisu】Certainly
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B86)
【Mayuri】Also, do you remember about the day Suzu-san tried to meet her father?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
【Mayuri】She thought if she went to the time machine offline meet, she could meet her him, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
We understood that since we tailed her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
【Mayuri】By the way, Daru-kun tried to go there too, right-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C06)
【Itaru】That was a seriously important offline meet for Japanese SF history... Well, it was lucky that we also got to tail Amane-shi though...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C22)
I don't remember that time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C32)
Because the world line changed via D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C42)
This is the curse of "Reading Steiner" so to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C52)
My memories before the change continue afterwards, so conversely, I have no memories of past events after the world line changes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CF6)
【Suzuha】I heard about that offline meet from Father. I only faintly remember it from childhood, but anyway, I thought I could meet him if I went there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D06)
【Itaru】So, since we met at that meet, does that settle it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D20)
【Suzuha】Hmmm, I wonder. At that point, maybe I couldn't recognize Hashida Itaru as Father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D30)
But that increases the circumstantial evidence that Daru is her father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D4A)
【Mayuri】Also, the time machine's name. She said it was something like FG204 Something Something, umm, what was it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D64)
【Suzuha】FG204 2nd EDITION ver. 2.31
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D74)
【Rintaro】Ugh, th-that naming sense, it's Daru's no doubt!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D8E)
【Mayuri】And I think that FG definitely stands for Future Gadget-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D9E)
So in other words, this time machine, is Future Gadget No. 204...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DAE)
【Mayuri】Lastly, the name. I think Mr. Barrel Titor can be nobody else but Daru-kun-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001DFE)
【Kurisu】That reminds me, last night, Mayuri asked me "What's barrel in Japanese?".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E46)
【Mayuri】Barrel means "taru" doesn't it? Chris-chan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E56)
Kurisu nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E66)
【Rintaro】...taru... Daru!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB6)
【Suzuha】A-a pun!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ED0)
【Mayuri】So, so, Suzu-san. Say "Hashida Itaru" ten times fast-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EE0)
【Suzuha】Wh-why?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EF0)
【Mayuri】You'll know if you say it-. Ehhehe-

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F24)
【Mayuri】Just now, didn't you hear "Ditor"?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F74)
【Kurisu】I did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F84)
【Mayuri】Hashidaitaru. Hashi-daita-ru. Hashi-Ditor-ru. Hashi-Titor-ru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FDA)
【Itaru】Really...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FF4)
【Mayuri】Yeah, really♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002004)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002020)
I-I can't believe it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002030)
With all this circumstantial evidence, I really can't just deny it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002040)
Everyone's jaw drops for a different reason this time, comparing Daru and Suzuha's looks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B6)
【Mayuri】I think they really look like father and daughter-♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020CE)
【Kurisu】That might be the <DICT>Placebo Effect</DICT>. When you mention it, they do kinda look alike.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020DE)
【Rintaro】Quite the achievement. Great Detective Shiina Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020F8)
【Mayuri】Eh? Detective? Ehhehe-, that's the first time anyone's said that-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002108)
This girl seems like she's airheaded, but maybe she's unexpectedly perceptive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002186)
【Itaru】Ah, augh... D-daughter...? Amane-shi is my daughter...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002196)
Daru squints his eyes and points at Suzuha while flapping his lips like a goldfish out of the tank.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021BC)
【Suzuha】...Father.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021CC)
【Itaru】A, aa, at times like these, call me "Papa".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021DC)
【Kurisu】At times like these, stop being a perv...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000021EC)
【Suzuha】Father...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002244)
Suzuha tries to hold back her tears, but couldn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002254)
The tears fell from her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000226E)
【Itaru】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000227E)
Daru also looks at that crying face and becomes seriously quiet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000228E)
【Suzuha】I came... So I could meet you, Father... I came riding on the time machine you made...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000229E)
【Itaru】...yeah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022AE)
【Suzuha】I'll be sure to accomplish what you tried to do, father...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022BE)
【Itaru】...yeah.

#WRITE(PTR, $000022CE)
【Suzuha】So I want you to watch.

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E8)
【Itaru】I'll watch. I absolutely will.

#WRITE(PTR, $000022F8)
Suzuha walks up to Daru and quietly hugs him.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002308)
Daru awkwardly, but firmly, catches her in his arms.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002318)
A strange father and daughter reunion, across time.

I thought it was good, from the bottom of my heart.

#WRITE(PTR, $00002364)
【Suzuha】Ahaha. That's a secret.

#WRITE(PTR, $000023B4)
Suzuha separates from Daru and smiles again.

#WRITE(PTR, $000023C4)
【Suzuha】Well then. With this, all my regrets for this world line are completely cut away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023DE)
【Suzuha】...I should get going.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000023EE)
【Rintaro】Wh-wait...! You're going already? Don't you have a lot to talk to your father about?

#WRITE(PTR, $000023FE)
--What the hell am I doing?

#WRITE(PTR, $0000240E)
I silently click my tongue at myself while detaining Suzuha.

Even if I detain her here, Suzuha won't stay, will she?

#WRITE(PTR, $0000242E)
It'll be troublesome if she does, since Mayuri's life depends on her leaving.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000243E)
So why am I trying to detain Suzuha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000244E)
【Suzuha】I'm okay. I'll be sure to get an IBN 5100.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002468)
While saying that, she shows us a dignified face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002478)
【Suzuha】Changing the future is up to you guys. I'll be sure to deliver the package here to Akihabara. Then I'll leave the rest to you all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002488)
【Suzuha】...Please. I want to change the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002498)
...Nobody answers that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A8)
Nobody says anything, or even nods.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B8)
But Suzuha definitely got the message.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C8)
Everything Suzuha entrusted to us. Her will. Her mission. As if swearing to protect them to the end, we tighten our expressions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D8)
The future Suzuha warned us of.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E8)
That isn't the future we wish for.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F8)
That's probably the very reason Daru and I form the Resistance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002508)
That's why this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002518)
So Mayuri won't die. So Kurisu won't be used by SERN.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002528)
So Daru can be with Suzuha as a normal father, we must change the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002542)
【Suzuha】Well then, let's meet in 35 years. Ah, for you guys, maybe a few hours, huh. Ahaha.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002552)
【Suzuha】Ah, oh yeah. When the time machine jumps through time, it lets off terrific ultraviolet rays, so you better not look directly at it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000256E)
With that final warning, Suzuha boards the time machine, quickly closing the hatch after waving her hand. Her figure disappears.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000257E)
The machine soon activates.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000258E)
The revolving lights attached underneath the fuselage light up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002602)
A shrill alarm starts ringing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002612)
Nothing comes out except sound.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002622)
It's quieter than you'd think.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002632)
The people walking underneath the building start cheering and screaming at the abnormality of the satellite. Everyone looks up and points.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D4)
I notice I got a mail from Suzuha and hurriedly open my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002838)
That "goodbye"--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002848)
The same single word parting message as before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002858)
Yet that word holds a completely different meaning than the one before. Almost like it's a different word.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002918)
Right after that, the air surrounding the time machine seems to mush and warp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002928)
A cocoon of light appears, enveloping the fuselage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002938)
I squint my eyes at the brilliance--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002948)
【Rintaro】Suzuha...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002958)
We can no longer meet her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002968)
No, maybe we can.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002978)
We're no doubt going to meet each other again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002988)
But between us is an immense wall of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002998)
No matter how much we pray.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029A8)
No matter how much we wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029B8)
No matter how much we shout.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029C8)
When we meet again, she won't be the girl I knew.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029D8)
Unexpectedly, Daru takes one step into the light.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029E8)
【Itaru】...Su, Susu, Suzuha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029F8)
【Itaru】Be sure to meet us again!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A08)
【Itaru】I'll do my best until then! I, I hate my meager vocabulary for not knowing any other way to say it, though!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A18)
【Itaru】Anyway, I'll do my best... So Suzuha, do your best too!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A28)
Those words probably won't reach her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A38)
Within that brightness, all I can do is block the light with my hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A48)
While shining particles fall, the cocoon slowly, slowly comes undone--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B6E)
And then before I notice it, the fuselage as large as a dump truck disappears without a trace, leaving just a hole in Radio Kaikan's wall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B7E)
Peeking through it, I can see Akihabara Station below.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B8E)
I can smell ozone due to the discharge of static electricity.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B9E)
The atmosphere undulates in waves as if increasing in density.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BAE)
For a short while, we silently stand in the summer breeze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BBE)
As if the wind were fate itself.
