Leaping really is instantaneous.

#WRITE(PTR, $00000262)
Titor said something like a 10 year jump takes an hour.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000272)
A 10 year jump--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000028E)
Right now, I have no use for that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000029E)
Furthermore, Kurisu said that time leaping that long an interval could cause mental disorders due to the gap in personality and memory.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002E6)
【Mayuri】Juicy Karaage Number One♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000002F6)
Mayuri's singing her own song, not eating Juicy Karaage Number One, but some Karaage-kun she bought at the convenience store.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000306)
Since she can't warm it up in the microwave, which is now a dedicated part of the Time Leap Machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000316)
...I was right to come back five hours.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000326)
Mayuri's still in the lab.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000336)
But just what exactly was that earlier?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000346)
I bite my lip at the bitter thoughts.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000432)
Mayuri died again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000442)
At Shin-Ochanomizu Station, a place completely unrelated to the lab or to the explosion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000452)
Tennouji Nae pushed her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000462)
She was run over by the train and torn to shreds.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000508)
Don't tell me that kid is a SERN conspirator?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000518)
No, those were a the actions of a normal little girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000528)
Nae has a habit of happily jumping to Mayuri whenever she sees her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000598)
But just what was with that timing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005A8)
I don't know--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005B8)
I sense malice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005C8)
Whose malice?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005D8)
If I have to say... then maybe it's a prank of fate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005E8)
But still, I've returned again, so I need to start acting immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000005F8)
I'll definitely save Mayuri. Since I can time leap, that's I can and must save her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000072C)
This time we take a taxi from Chuo Dori.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000073C)
This isn't the time to be thrifty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000074C)
Mayuri doesn't complain this time either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000075C)
I considered going back to her family in Ikebukuro, but Moeka's group might be lurking around their house. What are they doing now? I don't have a grasp on that pattern.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000076C)
So I decided to go to Shinagawa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000077C)
But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007CE)
The roads are abnormally crowded.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007DE)
The driver said it's never been this crowded before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007EE)
I thought that the road might even be closed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000007FE)
We escaped from Akiba, but we can't reach Shinagawa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000080E)
I thought of going getting off halfway and taking a train, but I decide not to once I remember what happened at Shin-Ochanomizu Station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000081E)
Nothing but bad feelings about this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000082E)
Thinking that this congestion could've been caused by Moeka's group, I keep looking around the car's circumference. So much that Mayuri warned me that my eyes look scary-.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000888)
Three hours pass.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000898)
The cars still don't move.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008A8)
According to the conversation between our driver and another driver I overheard, it seems like there's a large scale inspection ahead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008B8)
Furthermore, it doesn't seem like it's led by police, and some fight going on there, and such.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008C8)
Even more unluckily, this road has already been closed off, and all remaining cars are being detoured.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008D8)
Incidentally, including our taxi, there's only 100 cars, but the inspection has been at a standstill for three hours--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008E8)
Stuff like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008F8)
I can't believe this. I don't think it's a coincidence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000908)
Once again, I feel the malice of a prank of fate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000918)
Can I not save Mayuri this time either?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000928)
At this rate, we should've gotten off the taxi instead of waiting for it to move.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000938)
No, it's still not too late.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000948)
I should pay the driver and get off at once--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009C4)
Just as that thought passes my mind, a silhouette bangs on the window from outside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009D4)
Even though it's congested and the taxi is stopped in the middle of the road.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000009E4)
No, he's not just banging it, he opens the door and barges into the back seat with Mayuri and me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A00)
【Mayuri】Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A10)
In the man's hand, a blade.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A20)
He's an assassin!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A30)
【Rintaro】Run, Mayuri--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A40)
Before I can finish, the man gags Mayuri's mouth with his large hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A50)
Trying to escape somehow, I try opening the door.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A60)
But it won't open. The taxi is locked so that it can't be opened from the rear seat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B52)
【Mayuri】...ugh
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B62)
Mayuri opens her eyes wide.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B72)
Her body twitches.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B82)
【Rintaro】What--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B92)
In the narrow car. An unthinkable scene.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BA8)
I hurriedly avert my gaze.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BB8)
The man's knife pierced deep into Mayuri's chest.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000BC8)
A red spot stains her clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C70)
【Rintaro】Ah, ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C80)
【Rounder D】Don't speak, Okabe Rintaro.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C9C)
Another man gets into the passenger seat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CAC)
He points a gun at the driver and says something in a small voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CBC)
Strength drains from Mayuri's body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CCC)
Her eyes slowly close.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CDC)
Lines of tears stream from the corners of her eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CEC)
All of that, before my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CFC)
At a distance where I can feel her last breath.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D0C)
She was killed again--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D1C)
Why.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D2C)
Why!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D3C)
Why can't I save her!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D4C)
Why won't you let me save her!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D5C)
Who's the one who wants to kill Mayuri?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6C)
Moeka? SERN?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D7C)
Or--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D8C)
Does the world itself wish for Mayuri's death?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D9C)
I won't accept that...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DAC)
I clench my teeth hard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DBC)
I headbutt the man who stabbed her to death in the nose.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DCC)
【Rounder D】Guh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DDC)
【Rintaro】Open the door!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000DEC)
I shout to the driver.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F24)
I crawl out of the taxi and escape, weaving through the cars.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F34)
After running back to the lab for several hours, luckily the Time Leap Machine is still there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F44)
I'll leap through time again--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000110C)
TL06.PMF
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001472)
--Maybe it's impossible to run away with Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001482)
After going back six hours, I grab my head and bite my lip.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001492)
I feel like I've hit a dead end.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014A2)
I can't save Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014B2)
How should I save her?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014C2)
--Running away might be impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000014D2)
【Rintaro】Like hell it's impossible! I'll definitely save her!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000151A)
【Mayuri】Whatcha talking about-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000152A)
Mayuri just stares blankly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CA)
I take Mayuri and dash to the police station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016DA)
I ask them to protect her and tell several policemen the circumstances.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016EA)
I desperately explain that Mayuri's going to be killed in a few hours, but they turned us away with the explanation that the police can't act without hard evidence that a stalker will cause damages.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016FA)
Six hours pass since we left the police station, and in the end, we're left with no choices but to keep running.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000170A)
It would be great if everything was just a series of unfortunate events.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000171A)
Because then we could have second tries at charging Shin-Ochanomizu Station or Shinagawa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000172A)
But I don't have the courage to walk about the streets of Akiba now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000173A)
At the end of the day, the number of paths we can take are reduced.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001756)
Now I'm afraid to ride subways and taxis.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001766)
If we ride those, or rather, try to ride them, Mayuri will die--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001776)
That image sticks to my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001786)
What am I doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001796)
In these past dozens of hours, I've seen Mayuri die several times.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017A6)
I don't want to see Mayuri's pitiful figure any more.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001838)
We take refuge in Yodobashi Camera.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001848)
I thought we could keep hiding there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001858)
But after seven hours, the explosion happens in front of the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001868)
Yodobashi goes into chaos.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001878)
Several policemen appear to start evacuation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001888)
Anyone who doesn't comply is mistaken for a terrorist and shot.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001898)
Impossible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018A8)
This isn't America.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B8)
It's not normal for Japan's police to shoot guns without any warning shots.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018C8)
Mayuri died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018D8)
Quickly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018E8)
She got hit by a policeman's bullet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018F8)
It doesn't matter if they were real policemen or disguised SERN assassins.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001908)
I was convinced.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001918)
The world itself is killing Mayuri.
