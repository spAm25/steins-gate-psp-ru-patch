After going out of the lab, I sink into a chair at "MayQueen+Nyan⑯" and think.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000830)
Daru sits in front of me, impatiently waiting for Faris to bring us our order.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000008DC)
【Rintaro】Daru. What do you think about D-mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000098A)
【Itaru】Cool, and somehow uncool.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000A2E)
【Rintaro】What's uncool about it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000ADC)
【Itaru】It couldn't change the result of my RaiNet match with Faris-tan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000B80)
What a selfish reason...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000C24)
【Rintaro】It's become clear with all these experiments, but the precision of D-mail still hasn't reached a reliable level.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000CC8)
【Rintaro】It's defective as a device due to the involved element of luck. Unless we can somehow give the sender more control, it's going to end up as junk unfit for practical use.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000D6C)
In the first place, there's the problem with how only I can recognize the results of the changes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000E10)
When I think about how I couldn't have confirmed the experimental results without my special ability, it makes me keenly aware of how user-unfriendly it is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000EBE)
【Itaru】It's certainly not getting results, huh. What about the LOTO SIX case?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00000F62)
【Rintaro】Pending.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001006)
The fact that we missed due to Lukako's blunder does interest me, but what interests me more is why I would give the numbers to Lukako after getting the D-mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010AA)
It's as if Steins;Gate's choice guided money away from my grasp.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000114E)
Mm, no good, you're thinking negatively.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F2)
【Rintaro】The man known as Hououin Kyouma is not one to stumble at a point like this. I won't give up. For I am a mad scientist...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A0)
【Itaru】I don't understand what you're saying, but you sure seem confident about it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001344)
【Rintaro】That Microwave Ophone (Temp) will someday be improved so that humans may use it to send things towards the future. I'll improve it. No, I must improve it!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013E8)
【Rintaro】For that is Steins;Gate's choice! Fuhahahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001492)
【Faris】A time machine-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017CC)
【Rintaro】!!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000018B4)
Before I realized it, Faris is standing right next to me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001962)
【Rintaro】Tch, damn you Faris, eavesdropping is cowardly...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A10)
【Faris】What're you saying nya? Kyouma's voice is so loud, it echoed through the shop nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001ABE)
What... did you say...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B62)
Once again, I leaked classified information concerning the future of all mankind!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C10)
【Faris】Here's your iced coffee, and iced tea and "cat food". Thanks for waiting nyan♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CBE)
Daru's order of cat food is a standard menu item for this maid cafe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D62)
It's not miso over rice, but stylish risotto.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E06)
It's one of Daru's favorites. It's actually pretty tasty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001EB4)
The iced coffee is placed in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001F62)
【Faris】Do you want milk and syrup in it nyan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002006)
【Rintaro】I refuse.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000020B4)
【Faris】If Kyouma's gonna be like that, then I'll pour it all in nya~. You need a moderate amount of sugar for a healthy brain nyan♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002158)
Despite my refusal, Faris pours all of the milk and syrup into my glass,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000223C)
【Faris】Nyan nyan, nyan nyan♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000022E0)
all the while murmuring that nonsense and mixing my iced coffee with a straw before my eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F2)
【Itaru】There it is-! This is Faris-tan's secret technique, Mixing before Eyes-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002596)
Daru starts explaining in excitement.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002644)
【Itaru】Normally, it's hard to do it without spilling the drink, yet Faris-tan can calmly pull it off. That's what I love about her!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E8)
【Itaru】It's through this secret technique that Faris-tan reigns supreme as MayQueen's number one popular maid, exclamation mark!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000288C)
The iced coffee in the glass changes color from black to brown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002930)
Carried away by Faris' pace again, I gnash my teeth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A42)
Faris shows Daru the same secret technique.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002AF4)
【Itaru】Faris-tan, thank you! I shall be sure to savor it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BAA)
He bows deeply. Such a cordial man.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BCE)
I take a sidelong glance at Daru's excitement while taking a sip of my iced coffee. Its bitterness and sweetness flow through my throat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C16)
When I look to the side, suddenly I see Faris standing with her silver tray in front of her waist.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C26)
【Rintaro】Do you need something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C36)
【Faris】I wanna hear the rest nya♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C50)
【Faris】Kyouma and Daru-nyan were talking about something interesting nya? Something about a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C6E)
【Faris】Faris really wants to hear nya~n.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C7E)
She gives a babyish look with upturned eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C8E)
But I firmly repulse her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C9E)
【Rintaro】It's top secret. Not to be shown to outsiders!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CBC)
【Faris】Just who exactly was the one who talked so loud it echoed through the whole store nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CCC)
【Rintaro】......
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D1C)
【Faris】Daru-nya~n, Faris wants you to tell her nya....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D36)
Looks like she's targeting Daru now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DD4)
Don't take him lightly, Faris NyanNyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DE4)
Daru is my most trustworthy right hand man, the wizard-class supah hakah.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DF4)
He won't be tricked into divulging classified information to outsiders!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E62)
【Itaru】Actually, we made an amazing machine that can send mails into the past. Mostly I did.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E72)
An instant surrender!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E82)
Seduction is scary...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E9C)
【Faris】So that's basically a time machine nya!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EAC)
【Itaru】I guess you could say that-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EC6)
【Faris】It's pawesome that you could make a time machine nya. Faris is about to hnng over Daru-nyan's smartness nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE0)
【Itaru】Seriously-? Th-that's embarrassing, uheuhe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EF0)
Dumbass. What's with that smile...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F0A)
【Faris】Faris always dreamed of riding a time machine on a journey across timeow
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F24)
【Itaru】Someday, I'll bring you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F34)
【Rintaro】Daru, don't make promises you can't keep.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F88)
【Faris】By the way, this has always bugged me, but what exactly is timeow?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FA2)
【Rintaro】What...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FBC)
【Faris】Time is often compared to a river, flowing from past to future, right nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FD6)
【Faris】But is it really nya~?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003002)
【Faris】If it does flow like a river, then where is the "present" between past and future, nya? Is it a point? Is it a line? Where does the "present" begin and end, nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003012)
【Itaru】Now that you mention it, I do have a vague image of it, but I never gave it any serious thought.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003022)
【Rintaro】The "present" is a leaf floating on top of the river. It moves along with the flow from past to future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000303C)
【Faris】So then, is it pawppropriate to consider that all people ride on that leaf? When you die, do you fall off that leaf nyan?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000304C)
【Rintaro】That's probably right. All points upstream from that leaf are the past. Downstream, the future.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000306A)
【Faris】Hmnya, but~
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000307A)
【Faris】To humans, is that leaf the same as the "present" nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003094)
【Rintaro】Meaning...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030AE)
【Faris】I understand that humans observe time with units they defined, so the leaf is the "present". But--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030BE)
【Faris】Let's say that every living being in the universe goes extinct, which I think would mean nothing would exist to observe the "present" nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030D8)
【Faris】In that case, where does the "present" go nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030E8)
【Itaru】Wouldn't something like a god or the will of the universe observe it?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000310A)
【Faris】Then, if we consider that god as a <DICT>4th dimension</DICT>al being, can he freely move through the past and the present nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000311A)
【Rintaro】O-ohh...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003134)
【Faris】If that god's "present" becomes the standard, then wouldn't it be weird unless our "present" either goes to the past or goes to the future nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000314E)
【Itaru】Mmmmmm...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000315E)
【Rintaro】So basically, you want to say that the "present" depends on the observer's subjectivity, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003178)
【Faris】In that case, the past and the future also depend on the observer nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003188)
【Faris】If Faris were to use a time machine to time travel one week back, then Kyouma and Daru-nyan's "present" will differ from Faris' "present" by a week nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031A2)
【Itaru】Yeah, now that you mention it...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031BC)
【Faris】Then how's that difference represented by the leaf nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031CC)
Daru and I don't answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031DC)
That might be something nobody can answer, just like the "collapse of causality" thing that Kurisu mentioned.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031EC)
So does that mean that time machines and time travel are impossible after all?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000031FC)
But SERN's Jellymanned subjects physically transferred way back to 1921...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003216)
【Faris】In the first place, if things depend on the observer's subjectivity, then clocks become irrelevant, nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003230)
【Faris】Fun times fly, and painful times feel slow. So basically, the flow of time changes depending on subjectivity, nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000324A)
【Itaru】Speaking of which, as you grow older, it feels like time starts to flow faster, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003262)
【Rintaro】<DICT>Janet's law</DICT>, huh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000327C)
【Faris】So, Faris thinks about this sorta thing sometimes nya. That's why she thinks that time might not be something as simple as the flow of a river, nyan.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003296)
【Itaru】Yeah, the more you think about it, the deeper you get ensnared in the trap.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000333A)
The strict definition of tim is an eternal theme for humanity. Countless scholars of world renown have left this question unanswered.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000334A)
There's no way we can answer it. With that said--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033BA)
【Rintaro】Heh, heheheh, fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033D4)
【Faris】Nyanya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033E4)
【Rintaro】Fret not. Such philosophical and physical considerations are irrelevant to the time machine we're developing, making space-time jumping possible! Am I correct, Daru!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000033FE)
【Itaru】Yeah, yeah! That's right!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003418)
【Faris】Nyaa~... it's gotten serious nya.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003432)
【Faris】But Faris wants to try using the time machine you guys made nya~. Can I nya?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000344C)
【Itaru】Well, I don't have any objections to letting Faris-tan using it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003466)
【Faris】Really nya? It's a promise, nya!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003476)
【Rintaro】Daru, don't just decide things on your own!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003644)
Faris springs up with joy, hugging Daru's rotund body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003654)
It's enough to make Daru look like he ascended.
<FILEEND34>
